I need to analyze the market conditions across all coins to identify potential entry opportunities.\n\n## Market Analysis by Coin:\n\n**BTC (Current: $109,160)**\n- Price well below EMA20 ($111,104), indicating downtrend\n- MACD deeply negative (-1,429), showing strong bearish momentum\n- RSI(7) at 43.9 - recovering from oversold but still weak\n- RSI(14) at 37.4 - below neutral\n- Recent price action: Sharp drop from $111,268 to $108,211, now bouncing to $109,160\n- Volume significantly below average (3,549 vs 7,857)\n- Assessment: In downtrend but showing signs of bottoming. RSI divergence possible as price bounced from $108,211 but still risky to enter long here.\n\n**ETH (Current: $3,930.90)**\n- Price below EMA20 ($4,023), bearish structure\n- MACD negative (-71.78), bearish momentum\n- RSI(7) at 45.6 - neutral recovery from oversold\n- RSI(14) at 40.0 - below neutral\n- Recent action: Drop from $4,061 to $3,864, now recovering to $3,930\n- Volume very low (52,185 vs 135,854)\n- Assessment: Similar pattern to BTC - oversold bounce but not confirmed reversal yet.\n\n**SOL (Current: $186.91)**\n- Price significantly below EMA20 ($195.30), strong downtrend\n- MACD negative (-5.06), bearish\n- RSI(7) at 35.6 - weak, recovering from extreme oversold (19.0)\n- RSI(14) at 32.6 - oversold territory\n- Recent action: Dropped from $197 to $184.76, slight bounce to $186.91\n- Volume very low (464k vs 1.2M)\n- Assessment: Oversold but downtrend intact. Risky entry.\n\n**BNB (Current: $1,149.30)**\n- Price well below EMA20 ($1,188), downtrend\n- MACD negative (-31.54), bearish\n- RSI(7) at 37.8 - weak\n- RSI(14) at 32.6 - oversold\n- Recent action: Drop from $1,183 to $1,134, bouncing to $1,149\n- Volume extremely low (4,336 vs 19,294)\n- Assessment: Oversold but weak momentum. Not attractive.\n\n**XRP (Current: $2.36)**\n- Price below EMA20 ($2.44), downtrend\n- MACD negative (-0.058), bearish\n- RSI(7) at 41.5 - neutral, recovering from 20.3\n- RSI(14) at 35.1 - oversold\n- Recent action: Drop from $2.45 to $2.33, recovering to $2.36\n- Volume above average (13.1M vs 10.3M) - notable\n- Assessment: Showing relative strength with volume pickup. Most interesting setup.\n\n**DOGE (Current: $0.190230)**\n- Price below EMA20 ($0.198261), downtrend\n- MACD negative (-0.005), bearish\n- RSI(7) at 37.3 - weak\n- RSI(14) at 32.7 - oversold\n- Recent action: Drop from $0.200 to $0.187, slight recovery\n- Volume very low (16.2M vs 67.5M)\n- Assessment: Oversold but no volume support.\n\n## Trading Decision:\n\nAll coins are in downtrends with bearish technical indicators. However, several show oversold conditions with potential bottoming patterns. The safest approach for the first trade is to wait for clearer reversal signals OR take a small position in the strongest relative performer.\n\n**XRP** stands out because:\n1. Volume is ABOVE average (only coin showing this)\n2. RSI recovering from extreme oversold\n3. Smaller percentage decline vs other coins\n4. Price holding above recent lows better than others\n\nI'll take a conservative long position in XRP with tight risk management, risking only 5% of capital ($500).\n\nEntry: $2.36\nStop-loss: $2.28 (3.4% below entry, below recent low of $2.33)\nProfit target: $2.52 (6.8% above entry, near EMA20 resistance)\nInvalidation: If price closes below $2.30 on 3-minute candle (confirms breakdown)\nLeverage: 15x (moderate)\nPosition size calculation: $500 risk / ($2.36 - $2.28) / 15 = ~416 XRP\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 416,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.52,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.28,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.30 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown continuation\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

This is my second invocation at the start of trading, and I have no open positions currently.\n\n### Market Conditions Assessment:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $105,589 vs EMA20: $110,350 (-4.3%)\n- RSI(7): 17.8 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 22.3 - Deep oversold territory\n- MACD: -1,386 and accelerating downward\n- Price dropped from $111,268 to $105,589 in 30 minutes (-5.1%)\n- Below both 20 and 50 EMA (bearish structure)\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,756 vs EMA20: $3,986 (-5.8%)\n- RSI(7): 20.6 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 25.5 - Deep oversold\n- MACD: -68.5 and declining\n- Dropped from $4,061 to $3,756 (-7.5%)\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $177.65 vs EMA20: $193.22 (-8.1%)\n- RSI(7): 16.4 - MOST oversold of all coins\n- RSI(14): 21.5 - Extreme oversold\n- Down from $196.80 to $177.65 (-9.7%)\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,062.60 vs EMA20: $1,174.19 (-9.5%)\n- RSI(7): 9.5 - CATASTROPHICALLY oversold (lowest reading)\n- RSI(14): 14.7 - Extreme panic selling\n- Massive drop from $1,183.80 to $1,062.60 (-10.2%)\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.24 vs EMA20: $2.41 (-7.1%)\n- RSI(7): 17.4 - Extremely oversold\n- RSI(14): 21.1 - Deep oversold\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.17849 vs EMA20: $0.19555 (-8.7%)\n- RSI(7): 14.8 - Extremely oversold\n- RSI(14): 19.2 - Panic selling territory\n\n## Trading Decision Rationale:\n\nThis is a classic capitulation event with ALL coins showing:\n1. RSI(7) below 20 (extreme oversold)\n2. RSI(14) below 30 (oversold)\n3. Prices 5-10% below EMA20\n4. Negative MACD with accelerating momentum\n5. High volume confirming panic selling\n\n**Strategy:** This presents a high-probability mean reversion opportunity. When RSI(7) drops below 20 across the board, we typically see sharp bounces. However, I must be cautious:\n\n**Risk Considerations:**\n- This could be the start of a larger correction\n- Need tight stop-losses below recent lows\n- Will target BNB and SOL as they show the most extreme oversold conditions\n- Position sizing: Conservative given high volatility\n\n**Selected Trades:**\n\n1. **BNB** - RSI(7) at 9.5 is historically extreme. Entry at $1,062.60\n   - Stop-loss: $1,040 (below recent panic low, -2.1%)\n   - Profit target: $1,130 (back toward EMA20, +6.3%)\n   - Invalidation: If price makes new low below $1,040\n   - Risk: $500 (5% of portfolio)\n\n2. **SOL** - RSI(7) at 16.4, second most oversold. Entry at $177.65\n   - Stop-loss: $172 (below panic low, -3.2%)\n   - Profit target: $188 (partial retracement, +5.8%)\n   - Invalidation: If price breaks below $172\n   - Risk: $500 (5% of portfolio)\n\nTotal risk exposure: $1,000 (10% of portfolio) - Conservative for high-volatility conditions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 4.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 1130.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1040.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,040 on 3-minute candle, indicating continuation of breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 28.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 188.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 172.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $172 on 3-minute candle, confirming deeper correction\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.70,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

RSI at 18.18 indicates severe oversold conditions, but the broader trend is clearly bearish with price well below EMA20. The slight bounce to $1,071.70 could be a dead cat bounce. However, the extreme oversold RSI suggests potential for a relief rally. Since invalidation condition is NOT met, I should HOLD but monitor closely.\n\n## SOL Position Analysis\n- Entry: $177.65, Current: $181.47 (+2.15%)\n- Unrealized PnL: +$104.47\n- Stop-loss: $172.00, Profit target: $188.00\n- **Invalidation condition: \"If price closes below $172 on 3-minute candle\"**\n- Current price $181.47 is ABOVE $172 - invalidation NOT met\n- Technical indicators:\n  - RSI (7): 35.63 - oversold but recovering\n  - RSI (14): 33.61 - oversold\n  - MACD: -3.552 - negative but improving from -3.167\n  - Price below EMA20 ($190.58) - bearish trend\n  - Recent price action: Drop from $196.80 to $177.65, now recovering to $181.47\n  \n**Analysis**: Position is profitable and showing signs of recovery. The bounce from $177.65 to $181.47 is encouraging. RSI has improved from 16.43 to 35.63, showing momentum shift. Price is still below EMA20 but the recovery is stronger than BNB. Invalidation condition NOT met. The position is moving toward profit target ($188). HOLD and let it run.\n\n## Other Coins (No Positions)\n- **BTC**: RSI 19.33 - extremely oversold, price $105,671 down from $111,288. Severe selloff but could bounce\n- **ETH**: RSI 27.02 - oversold, price $3,777 down from $4,061. Similar pattern to BTC\n- **XRP**: RSI 35.63 - oversold, price $2.28 down from $2.45\n- **DOGE**: RSI 33.67 - oversold, price $0.1826 down from $0.2003\n\n**Market Context**: Broad market selloff across all coins. Extremely oversold conditions (RSI < 30 on most) suggest potential for relief rally, but trend remains bearish. With limited capital ($9,293) and two open positions, I should not add new positions. Focus on managing existing trades.\n\n## Risk Management\n- Current account value: $10,096.40\n- Total return: +0.96%\n- Two positions totaling ~$9,904 notional (highly leveraged at 15x)\n- Available cash: $9,293.11\n- Both positions are in oversold territory with potential for recovery\n\n**Decision**: HOLD both positions as neither invalidation condition has been met. SOL showing better recovery momentum. BNB more concerning but extreme oversold could lead to bounce.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 4.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 1130.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1040.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,040 on 3-minute candle, indicating continuation of breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 28.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 188.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 172.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $172 on 3-minute candle, confirming deeper correction\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The extreme oversold RSI suggests potential for a bounce, though the overall trend is bearish.\n\n### SOL Position Analysis\n- **Entry**: 177.65 | **Current**: 182.74 | **Unrealized P&L**: +$140.03 (+2.81%)\n- **Stop-loss**: 172.00 | **Profit target**: 188.00\n- **Invalidation condition**: \"If price closes below $172 on 3-minute candle\"\n- **Status**: Price is at 182.74, well ABOVE the stop-loss of 172\n- **Technical analysis**:\n  - RSI(7) at 41.6 shows recovery from oversold levels (was at 16.4)\n  - Price bounced from 177.65 low to 182.74 (+2.86%)\n  - Still below EMA20 (189.96) but showing strength\n  - MACD at -3.9 (negative but improving)\n  - Profit target at 188 is only $5.26 away (2.9% more upside)\n  - The invalidation condition has NOT been met (not below 172)\n- **Decision**: HOLD - Position is profitable with good momentum. Price is recovering and approaching profit target. The invalidation condition has not been triggered.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\nAll other coins (BTC, ETH, XRP, DOGE) show bearish conditions with prices below EMAs, negative MACD, and oversold RSI. However, given:\n1. I already have 2 leveraged positions (risk exposure ~$10k notional)\n2. Market is in clear downtrend\n3. Available cash is $9,293 (need to preserve capital)\n4. Both existing positions are profitable\n\n**Decision**: No new positions.

Price is below EMA20, MACD remains negative, and RSI shows weakening momentum. The recent rejection from $1,118 and pullback to $1,092 suggests resistance. With +$129.91 profit secured, it's prudent to take profits given the weakening technicals rather than risk a reversal. The position is up 2.77% which is solid for a leveraged trade.\n\n## SOL Position Analysis\n- Entry: $177.65, Current: $187.47 (+5.53%)\n- Unrealized P&L: +$272.47\n- Stop-loss: $172.00, Profit target: $188.00\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below $172 on 3-minute candle\"\n- Current technical state:\n  * Price at $187.47, just $0.53 from profit target ($188.00)\n  * RSI(7): 71.21 - overbought territory\n  * MACD: -1.921 (negative but improving rapidly)\n  * Price above EMA20 ($186.90), showing strength\n  * Strong upward momentum with RSI climbing from 35.98 to 71.21\n  \n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION**\nReasoning: Price is within $0.53 of the profit target ($188.00), representing a 5.53% gain. RSI at 71.21 indicates overbought conditions and potential for pullback. The profit target is nearly achieved, and with such strong unrealized gains (+$272.47), it's optimal to lock in profits rather than risk a reversal from overbought levels. This represents excellent execution of the trade plan.\n\n## Other Coins (BTC, ETH, XRP, DOGE)\n- No existing positions\n- Market conditions: Mixed signals across the board\n- BTC: Below EMA20, negative MACD, RSI 55 (neutral)\n- ETH: Near EMA20, negative MACD improving, RSI 61 (slightly bullish)\n- XRP: At EMA20, MACD improving, RSI 57 (neutral)\n- DOGE: At EMA20, MACD improving, RSI 73 (overbought)\n\n**Decision: NO NEW POSITIONS**\nReasoning: With two profitable positions being closed, I'll have ~$10,775 in capital. However, the market shows mixed signals without clear high-probability setups. BTC remains in a downtrend below EMA20. ETH and XRP show improvement but lack conviction. DOGE is overbought.

The profit target of $195.00 is very close (only $2.07 away). However, the invalidation condition has NOT been met - price remains well above $184.50 and the uptrend is intact with positive MACD and price above EMA20.\n\nGiven:\n1. Invalidation condition NOT met (no close below $184.50)\n2. Strong bullish momentum (MACD positive and rising)\n3. Profit target very close ($2.07 away)\n4. RSI at 77 shows strength but not extreme exhaustion\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - The position should remain open as the invalidation condition has not been triggered and we're approaching the profit target. The technical setup remains bullish.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** RSI 91.2 - extremely overbought, but strong momentum. Price at $111,161 with MACD strongly positive. No position currently.\n\n**ETH:** RSI 92.9 - extremely overbought, similar to BTC. Strong uptrend but extended.\n\n**BNB:** RSI 67.3 - moderate, MACD still negative. Less compelling.\n\n**XRP:** RSI 87.7 - very overbought, strong momentum.\n\n**DOGE:** RSI 86.1 - very overbought, strong momentum.\n\nGiven we already have exposure through SOL and most coins are showing extreme overbought conditions (RSI >85), it's prudent to avoid opening new positions at these extended levels.

Price has NOT closed below $184.50. Current price $190.41 is well above the stop-loss level. The position remains valid.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nDespite the momentum cooling (RSI dropping, MACD declining), the position is still profitable and above all critical support levels. The pullback from $192.93 to $190.41 is normal profit-taking behavior. With 15x leverage, I need to be cautious, but there's no technical reason to exit yet. The profit target of $195 is still achievable if momentum resumes.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Position is +0.85% in profit\n- Stop-loss provides 2.3% downside protection\n- 15x leverage means tight risk management is critical\n- No signs of invalidation or stop-loss breach\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC: RSI 86.5 extremely overbought, but no position\n- ETH: RSI cooling from 93.8 to 52.5, significant pullback underway\n- BNB: RSI 43.9, neutral but declining\n- XRP: RSI 77.2, strong but overbought\n- DOGE: RSI 65.0, moderate strength\n\nGiven the overall market showing signs of cooling (multiple coins with declining RSI), I'll maintain my SOL position but remain vigilant.

The invalidation condition has **NOT been met**. Price has not closed below $184.50.\n\n**Decision Rationale**:\nThe position is essentially flat (-$2.24), and while we're seeing a pullback with RSI cooling off from overbought levels, this is healthy price action. The price remains above the 20-period EMA ($187.94), MACD is still positive, and we're nowhere near the stop-loss or invalidation level. The pullback from $192.93 to $188.77 is a normal retracement after the strong move up. The invalidation condition is clear and has not been triggered.\n\n**Decision**: HOLD - Continue monitoring. No exit conditions met.\n\n## Market Opportunities Assessment\n\n### BTC Analysis\n- Strong uptrend: $106,726 \u2192 $110,753 (+3.77%)\n- RSI (7): 70.25 - approaching overbought but not extreme\n- MACD: 1055.25 - very strong momentum\n- Price well above EMA20 ($110,753 vs $108,753)\n- High volume (8,550 vs avg 4,155)\n- **Assessment**: Strong momentum but already extended. RSI near 70 suggests limited upside in short term. Pass for now.\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- Price: $3,980.40, above EMA20 ($3,938.84)\n- RSI (7): 40.56 - cooling off sharply from 93.78\n- RSI (14): 56.03 - neutral\n- MACD: 51.93 - positive but declining\n- **Assessment**: Healthy pullback after overbought conditions. Could be setting up, but not compelling enough given current SOL position.\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- Explosive move: $2.35 \u2192 $2.52 (+7.23%)\n- RSI (7): 89.38 - EXTREMELY overbought\n- RSI (14): 84.45 - very overbought\n- MACD: 0.044 - strong momentum\n- Price well above EMA20 ($2.52 vs $2.40)\n- **Assessment**: Parabolic move with extreme RSI. High risk of sharp reversal. Too dangerous to enter here.\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- Price: $0.19953, above EMA20 ($0.19370)\n- RSI (7): 66.69 - elevated but not extreme\n- RSI (14): 72.69 - moderately overbought\n- MACD: 0.004 - positive momentum\n- **Assessment**: Decent setup but not compelling enough to add another position.\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- Price: $1,100.90, just below EMA20 ($1,101.76)\n- RSI (7): 32.17 - oversold territory\n- RSI (14): 45.67 - neutral/weak\n- MACD: 9.03 - positive but declining\n- **Assessment**: Showing weakness, pulling back. Not a good entry point.\n\n## Risk Management Review\n- Current account value: $10,464.65\n- Available cash: $10,257.60\n- Single position (SOL): $3,139 notional (30% of account at 15x leverage)\n- Position is essentially flat, well-managed with clear exit plan\n- Sharpe ratio: 21.93 - excellent risk-adjusted returns\n\n## Final Decision\nHold the SOL position as invalidation condition has not been met and technical structure remains intact. No new positions warranted given current market conditions (BTC/XRP too extended, others not compelling).\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 16.63,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 184.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $184.50 on 3-minute candle, indicating support breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 209.37\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

While RSI shows extreme oversold conditions that could lead to a bounce, the invalidation condition is nearly triggered. The price has broken below the entry point and is testing critical support.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nGiven that:\n1. We're only $0.96 away from stop-loss\n2. The invalidation condition states \"closes below $184.50\" - we haven't closed below yet, but we're at risk\n3. Extreme oversold RSI could provide a bounce opportunity\n4. Risk management suggests we should respect our pre-defined stop-loss\n\nHowever, the proximity to stop-loss and the sharp downward momentum suggest high risk. The prudent decision is to **CLOSE** this position to protect capital, as we're essentially at our stop-loss level and the momentum is clearly bearish.\n\n## Market Overview for Other Coins\n\n**BTC:** RSI(7) at 26.889 - extremely oversold after sharp drop from 111161 to 109008. Below EMA20. Not entering - catching falling knife.\n\n**ETH:** RSI(7) at 20.020 - extremely oversold. Price at 3922.60 vs EMA20 at 3944.83. Sharp selloff. Not entering.\n\n**BNB:** RSI(7) at 16.018 - extremely oversold. Price 1081.30 vs EMA20 1099.32. Severe weakness. Not entering.\n\n**XRP:** RSI(7) at 45.061 - neutral zone.

Account value is $10,408.11 with 4.08% total return and excellent Sharpe ratio of 12.867.\n\nLet me analyze each coin for potential entry opportunities:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $108,019 vs EMA20: $108,879 (below EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 18.022 - EXTREMELY oversold (below 20)\n- RSI(14): 35.284 - oversold territory\n- MACD: 691.805 declining rapidly from 1003.973\n- Price dropped sharply from $111,161 to $108,019 in last 30 minutes\n- Strong bearish momentum but extreme oversold suggests potential bounce\n- Volume spike: 9164.929 vs avg 3976.083 (2.3x average)\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,891.90 vs EMA20: $3,945.06 (below EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 14.585 - EXTREMELY oversold (critical level)\n- RSI(14): 30.722 - oversold\n- MACD: 19.756 declining from 40.070\n- Sharp drop from $4,053.40 to $3,891.90\n- Volume elevated: 109,088 vs avg 71,049\n- Extreme oversold conditions suggest potential reversal\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $184.93 vs EMA20: $187.86 (below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 22.168 - oversold\n- RSI(14): 34.597 - approaching oversold\n- MACD: 0.615 declining\n- Moderate decline from $192.93\n- Less extreme than BTC/ETH\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,071.30 vs EMA20: $1,099.19 (significantly below)\n- RSI(7): 11.736 - MOST EXTREMELY oversold of all coins\n- RSI(14): 26.740 - very oversold\n- MACD: -0.513 (negative and declining)\n- Sharp drop from $1,127.90 to $1,071.30\n- Most oversold condition across all assets\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.43 vs EMA20: $2.42 (slightly above EMA - neutral)\n- RSI(7): 35.448 - approaching oversold but not extreme\n- RSI(14): 47.792 - neutral territory\n- MACD: 0.032 (positive but declining)\n- Relatively stable compared to others\n- Volume spike: 13.38M vs avg 4.57M (2.9x)\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.19416 vs EMA20: $0.19476 (slightly below)\n- RSI(7): 22.808 - oversold\n- RSI(14): 41.279 - neutral\n- MACD: 0.003 (stable)\n- Moderate decline from $0.20115\n\n## Trading Decision Rationale\n\nThe market is showing extreme oversold conditions across major assets (BTC, ETH, BNB). This presents potential mean reversion opportunities. However, the sharp decline could continue, so I need careful risk management.\n\n**Best Opportunities:**\n1. **BNB** - RSI(7) at 11.736 is the most extreme oversold reading. High probability of bounce\n2. **ETH** - RSI(7) at 14.585, second most oversold. Large cap with good liquidity\n3. **BTC** - RSI(7) at 18.022, also extreme but already showing some stabilization\n\n**Strategy:** Enter mean reversion trades on the most oversold assets with tight stop-losses below recent lows. Target quick bounces back to EMA20 levels.\n\nI'll take positions in BNB and ETH as they show the most extreme oversold conditions with highest probability of bounce.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 4.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 1099.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1060.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,060 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 10\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 750.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.3,\n      \"profit_target\": 3945.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3865.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,865 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 12\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 525.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

MACD is deeply negative and declining, price is well below EMA20, and RSI shows oversold conditions. However, the invalidation condition has NOT been triggered. The bounce from $1,071.30 to $1,076.10 suggests potential short-term support. Given that invalidation is not met and we have a small profit, I'll HOLD but monitor closely.\n\n## ETH Position Analysis\n- Entry: $3,891.90, Current: $3,890.10 (-$4.87 unrealized PnL)\n- Profit target: $3,945.00 (need +$54.90 move)\n- Stop-loss: $3,865.00 (risk -$26.90 move)\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below $3,865 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 12\"\n\n**Technical Review:**\n- RSI(7): 14.200 - ABOVE invalidation level of 12, but extremely oversold\n- RSI(14): 29.765 - Deeply oversold\n- MACD: 9.138 - Still positive but declining rapidly from 34.702\n- Price vs EMA20: $3,890.10 vs $3,942.75 - Trading $52.65 below EMA (bearish)\n- Recent price action: Sharp decline from $4,053.40 to $3,890.10 (-$163.30)\n\n**Invalidation Check:** NOT MET - Price is above $3,865 and RSI(7) is 14.200 (above 12)\n\n**Decision Rationale:** This position is barely underwater (-$4.87). The RSI(7) at 14.200 is dangerously close to the invalidation level of 12, having dropped from 93.652 to 14.200 - a massive momentum shift. However, the invalidation condition has NOT been technically triggered yet. The extreme oversold RSI suggests potential for a bounce, but the rapid decline is concerning. Price is $25 above stop-loss. I'll HOLD as invalidation is not met, but this is on thin ice.\n\n## Market Overview for Other Coins\n- **BTC**: RSI(7) 33.958, price below EMA20, declining momentum - No position, not entering\n- **SOL**: RSI(7) 37.101, price below EMA20, weak momentum - No position, not entering  \n- **XRP**: RSI(7) 38.327, price above EMA20, positive MACD - No position, not entering\n- **DOGE**: RSI(7) 26.377, price below EMA20, weak momentum - No position, not entering\n\nAll markets showing weakness after recent rallies. Not opening new positions given the broad market pullback and existing exposure.\n\n## Risk Management Summary\n- Current account value: $10,418.77 (+4.19% return)\n- Total exposure: ~$9,900 notional across 2 positions\n- Both positions showing technical weakness but invalidation conditions not met\n- Sharpe ratio of 12.867 is excellent - protecting gains is priority\n\n**Final Decision:** HOLD both positions as neither invalidation condition has been triggered, but monitor very closely for any further deterioration.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 4.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 1099.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1060.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,060 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 10\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 750.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.3,\n      \"profit_target\": 3945.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3865.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,865 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 12\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 525.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

RSI at 68.3 leaves some room. MACD negative but improving. This is the most reasonable entry among major coins.\n\n**Decision**: CONSIDER - Best risk/reward among the majors.\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- Current price: $2.52 (spike from $2.43 to $2.52)\n- Price above EMA20 ($2.43) - bullish\n- RSI (7): 72.7 - overbought\n- RSI (14): 68.0 - moderately overbought\n- MACD: 0.027 - positive and rising\n- Volume: 12,979,067 vs avg 5,051,749 (2.57x average - strong)\n- Strong uptrend with higher lows\n\n**Assessment**: Overbought but showing consistent strength.

Overbought levels.\n\n**Decision**: PASS - Too volatile and extended.\n\n## Final Trading Decision\n\nGiven the synchronized market-wide spike across all assets with extreme overbought conditions (RSI 7-period above 70 for all coins), this appears to be a coordinated move, possibly driven by macro news or large institutional flow.\n\n**Risk Assessment**: Entering at these levels carries high reversal risk. The prudent approach is to wait for:\n1. Consolidation after this spike\n2. RSI cooling to 50-60 range\n3. Confirmation of trend continuation\n\n**Portfolio Strategy**: With 8.22% returns and excellent Sharpe ratio, preserving capital is paramount. No positions means no risk of drawdown from potential reversal.\n\n**Action**: STAY IN CASH - Wait for better entry opportunities with lower risk/reward ratios.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

Price closes below $3,820 - NOT MET (current $3,857.10 is above)\n2.

It's hovering dangerously close to the 30 threshold. The price is also showing weakness with MACD collapsing from 35.551 to 2.182.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Position is underwater by $50.70\n- Price is $37.10 away from stop-loss (only 0.96% buffer)\n- RSI is dangerously close to invalidation level\n- MACD showing strong bearish momentum\n- Price well below EMA20 indicating downtrend\n\n**Decision:** CLOSE POSITION\nThe invalidation condition is essentially met - RSI(7) at 32.167 is precariously close to 30 and showing no bounce (declining from 33.853). The technical picture has deteriorated significantly with MACD collapsing and price well below EMA20. Rather than wait for the stop-loss to be hit or RSI to break below 30, prudent risk management dictates closing this position now to preserve capital.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC, SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE: All showing similar weakness with RSI(7) in 34-38 range, prices below EMA20, declining MACD. Market conditions are bearish across the board. Not entering new positions in this environment.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 3.35,\n      \"profit_target\": 3951.56,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3820.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,820 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 30 without bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 130.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation condition nearly met - RSI(7) at 32.167 dangerously close to 30 threshold with no bounce, MACD collapsing from 35.551 to 2.182 showing strong bearish momentum, price $84.82 below EMA20.

This suggests a coordinated market pullback.\n\n**Risk Assessment:** \n- Low volume on most coins (except DOGE at 91% and SOL at 87%) suggests weak conviction\n- All MACD indicators are negative or declining\n- This could be a dead cat bounce setup or genuine oversold bounce opportunity\n\n**Strategy:** Given the extreme oversold conditions across the board, I'll look for a mean reversion play on the most oversold coin with relatively better volume. DOGE shows RSI(7) at 29.10 (most oversold) with decent volume at 91% of average, making it the best candidate for a bounce trade.\n\nHowever, given the coordinated weakness and low volumes across most assets, I'll take a CONSERVATIVE approach with tight risk management. I'll enter DOGE with moderate leverage (12x) and strict stop-loss.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 31500,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.1985,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.1895,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.1895 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) fails to recover above 40 within next 3 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 508.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

We entered this position when RSI was around 29.124, expecting a bounce. However, RSI has continued to deteriorate to 26.207, failing to recover above 40.\n\n**Decision**: CLOSE POSITION\n- Invalidation condition is MET - RSI(7) has failed to recover above 40 and is actually getting worse\n- Price is dangerously close to stop-loss (0.1895 vs current 0.19086)\n- Strong bearish momentum with price below EMA20\n- Better to take small loss now than risk hitting stop-loss or liquidation\n\n## Market Overview for Other Coins\n\n**BTC**: RSI(7) 30.867 (oversold), price 107502 below EMA20 108979, MACD declining - bearish short-term\n\n**ETH**: RSI(7) 28.247 (oversold), price 3827.60 below EMA20 3924.15, MACD negative - bearish\n\n**SOL**: RSI(7) 34.975 (oversold), price 184.99 below EMA20 187.77, MACD negative - bearish\n\n**BNB**: RSI(7) 40.325 (neutral-low), price 1068.70 below EMA20 1085.93, MACD negative - bearish\n\n**XRP**: RSI(7) 28.032 (oversold), price 2.39 below EMA20 2.43, MACD positive but declining - bearish\n\nAll major coins are showing oversold conditions with prices below their EMA20s. This suggests a broader market pullback. While oversold conditions can lead to bounces, the momentum indicators (MACD) are all declining or negative, suggesting the selling pressure hasn't exhausted yet. \n\n**Risk Management Decision**: Given the current market-wide weakness and my DOGE position already in the red with invalidation met, I will close DOGE and wait for clearer reversal signals before entering new positions. The oversold readings could lead to bounces, but without confirmation of trend reversal, it's premature to enter.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 31500.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.1985,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.1895,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.1895 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) fails to recover above 40 within next 3 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 508.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation condition met - RSI(7) failed to recover above 40 and continued declining to 26.207, showing persistent weakness.

Price is below EMA20 and trending down\n2. MACD remains deeply negative (-12.17)\n3. While above the invalidation level ($1,055), we're only $13.90 away\n4. The position is underwater by $49.67\n5. Recent candles show continued weakness (1080.30 \u2192 1068.90)\n\nHowever, the invalidation condition has NOT been met yet. The price has not closed below $1,055. The stop-loss at $1,050 is still intact.\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - The invalidation condition is clear and has not been triggered. Price is at $1,068.90, which is above $1,055. While the technical picture is weak, I must follow my exit plan discipline. If the next candle closes below $1,055, I will exit immediately.\n\n## Market Overview for Other Coins\n\n**BTC:** $107,840 - RSI 38.4 (oversold territory), MACD negative (-196.93), below EMA20. Bearish momentum but potentially oversold. Not entering due to existing BNB exposure.\n\n**ETH:** $3,802.30 - RSI 25.4 (deeply oversold), MACD -39.07, below EMA20. Very oversold but downtrend intact. Too risky to enter.\n\n**SOL:** $180.17 - RSI 17.5 (extremely oversold), MACD -1.80, below EMA20. Most oversold of all coins but catching falling knives is dangerous.\n\n**XRP:** $2.38 - RSI 22.8 (oversold), MACD -0.004, below EMA20. Oversold but weak.\n\n**DOGE:** $0.19048 - RSI 28.4 (oversold), MACD -0.001, below EMA20. Oversold but no clear reversal signal.\n\n**Risk Management:** With one losing position, I should not add new positions in this bearish environment. All coins are showing weakness with negative MACD and prices below EMA20. Better to preserve capital and wait for clearer setups.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 4.16,\n      \"profit_target\": 1130.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1050.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,055 on 3-minute candle, indicating failed recovery and continuation of downtrend\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 450.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price is above EMA20, RSI shows healthy momentum (64.78), and MACD is improving. However, the low volume (34% of average) is concerning and suggests weak conviction in this move. The position is still valid technically, but the risk/reward is becoming less favorable as we're closer to the stop-loss ($1,050) than the profit target ($1,130).\n\nGiven:\n1. Invalidation NOT met (price well above $1,055)\n2. Stop-loss NOT hit ($1,050)\n3. Profit target NOT reached ($1,130)\n4. Technical indicators showing neutral to slightly bullish\n5. Low volume is a concern but not a deal-breaker\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - Continue monitoring. The position remains valid with no exit conditions met.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** Price $108,377, below EMA20 ($108,860). RSI 51.9 neutral, MACD negative (-312.6). Downtrend from $113,386. Not entering - weak momentum.\n\n**ETH:** Price $3,825, well below EMA20 ($3,898). RSI 40.7 weak, MACD negative (-44.5). Clear downtrend from $4,082. Not entering - bearish.\n\n**SOL:** Price $182.79, below EMA20 ($185.90). RSI 45.8, MACD negative (-1.684). Downtrend from $196. Not entering - weak.\n\n**XRP:** Price $2.38, below EMA20 ($2.41). RSI 35.8 oversold, MACD negative (-0.009). Downtrend from $2.52. Oversold but no reversal signal yet.\n\n**DOGE:** Price $0.1909, below EMA20 ($0.1943). RSI 39.5 weak, MACD negative (-0.002). Downtrend from $0.2042. Not entering - weak.\n\n**Overall Market Assessment:** Broad weakness across all coins with prices below EMAs, negative MACD readings, and weak RSI. BNB is the only position showing relative strength. No new entries warranted in this environment.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 4.16,\n      \"profit_target\": 1130.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1050.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,055 on 3-minute candle, indicating failed recovery and continuation of downtrend\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 450.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

While the position is profitable and the invalidation condition ($1,055) has NOT been met, the technical setup suggests an imminent pullback. The MACD is still negative, indicating underlying bearish momentum despite the recent rally. \n\nHowever, the invalidation condition is clear: close below $1,055. Current price is $1,108.70, well above this level. The position is up 2.63% and approaching the profit target of $1,130 (only $21.30 away).\n\n**Decision**: **HOLD** - The invalidation condition has not been triggered. Price is above $1,055 and moving toward profit target. While RSI is extremely overbought suggesting caution, I should respect the exit plan and let it run to either profit target ($1,130) or stop-loss ($1,050). The position is well-managed with clear risk parameters.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n### BTC\n- Price: $109,289 (recovering from lows)\n- RSI (7): 65.076 - Neutral to slightly overbought\n- MACD: -505.857 (still deeply negative)\n- Below EMA20 ($109,105) but recovering\n- **No position, not entering** - MACD still very negative, mixed signals\n\n### ETH\n- Price: $3,879.10\n- RSI (7): 64.111 - Neutral\n- MACD: -48.451 (negative, improving slightly)\n- Below EMA20 ($3,903)\n- **No position, not entering** - Still below EMA, weak momentum\n\n### SOL\n- Price: $187.39\n- RSI (7): 69.173 - Overbought\n- MACD: -1.948 (negative but minimal)\n- Above EMA20 ($186.50)\n- **No position, not entering** - Already overbought, late to enter\n\n### XRP\n- Price: $2.41\n- RSI (7): 58.180 - Neutral\n- MACD: -0.016 (nearly neutral)\n- Below EMA20 ($2.42)\n- **No position, not entering** - Weak setup, no clear edge\n\n### DOGE\n- Price: $0.193860\n- RSI (7): 63.512 - Neutral\n- MACD: -0.002 (nearly neutral)\n- Below EMA20 ($0.194756)\n- **No position, not entering** - No compelling setup\n\n## Risk Management\n- Current account value: $10,255.33\n- Available cash: $9,831.96\n- Single position (BNB) at 15x leverage\n- Position size: $4,612 notional (~45% of account)\n- Unrealized profit: $115.90\n\nThe portfolio is appropriately sized with one leveraged position.

Strong momentum, RSI not extreme, improving MACD\n2. **BNB** - Exceptional volume breakout, but RSI very high - will monitor\n3. **SOL** - Too overbought (RSI 80.6), high risk of immediate reversal\n4. **ETH** - Still below EMA20, weaker relative strength\n5. **XRP/DOGE** - No clear edge\n\n**Strategy**: Enter BTC with conservative position sizing due to elevated RSI. Set tight stop-loss below recent support at $108,000. Target resistance near $112,000.\n\nRisk management:\n- Position size: ~$1,500 risk (15% of capital)\n- Leverage: 15x (moderate given strong trend)\n- Stop-loss: $108,500 (1.28% below entry)\n- Profit target: $112,000 (1.90% above entry)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.14,\n      \"profit_target\": 112000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 108500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $108,000 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 50 while price is below EMA20\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price is above $108,000, RSI(7) is well above 50, and price is trading above EMA20. While RSI shows overbought conditions suggesting caution, the momentum is positive with improving MACD and price strength. The position has room to run toward the $112,000 profit target. No reason to exit prematurely.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- **SOL**: Strong momentum (RSI 80.921, price above EMA), but already overbought. No position, not entering at these extended levels.\n- **BNB**: Good momentum (MACD turned positive, RSI 63.6), but would need to see consolidation before entry.\n- **ETH**: Weak - below EMA20, RSI neutral at 50, MACD negative. Not attractive.\n- **XRP**: Consolidating below EMA20, weak momentum. Pass.\n- **DOGE**: Recovering but still below longer-term EMA.

However, the invalidation condition requires BOTH conditions: \"RSI(7) drops below 50 while price is below EMA20\". Currently:\n- RSI(7) < 50: TRUE (44.879)\n- Price < EMA20: FALSE (110,109 > 109,594)\n\nSince price is still above EMA20, the invalidation condition is NOT fully met. However, this is a warning sign.\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n- Price dropped sharply from $111,100 to $110,109 (last candle shows -$991 drop)\n- RSI(7) crashed from 85.064 to 44.879 - massive momentum loss\n- RSI(14) dropped from 70.827 to 53.962\n- MACD still positive at 487.189 but declining from 507.593\n- Price still above EMA20 ($109,594) providing support\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nThis is a concerning reversal pattern. The sharp drop in RSI suggests momentum has shifted. While the invalidation condition isn't technically met yet, we're very close. If price drops below EMA20 ($109,594), the invalidation would trigger immediately.\n\n**Decision:** CLOSE POSITION\nReason: Risk management - the sharp momentum reversal (RSI drop from 85 to 44) and large price drop suggest a potential trend change. While invalidation isn't technically met, we're dangerously close. Better to take the small profit (+$20) than risk a larger loss if price breaks below EMA20.\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- **ETH**: Price at $3,890, near EMA20 ($3,885). RSI(7) at 45.165 shows weakness after dropping from 81.314. Not entering - momentum unclear.\n- **SOL**: Price $189.29, RSI(7) crashed to 38.006 from 83.354. Sharp reversal, too risky to enter.\n- **BNB**: Price $1,103.40, RSI(7) at 34.252 - oversold but in downtrend. Not entering.\n- **XRP**: Price $2.48, RSI(7) at 87.315 - extremely overbought. Too late to enter, likely to reverse.\n- **DOGE**: Price $0.194840, RSI(7) at 43.865 after dropping from 78.622.

MACD remains positive, price is above EMA20, and the overall trend structure is intact.\n\nGiven that:\n1. No invalidation conditions are met\n2. Stop-loss not threatened\n3. Technical structure remains bullish\n4. Only 23 minutes into trading with small unrealized loss\n\n**Action: HOLD** - Continue monitoring for either profit target at $198.50 or invalidation conditions.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** RSI(7) at 79.3 (overbought), strong momentum but extended. No position, not entering at these levels.\n\n**ETH:** RSI(7) at 65.6, decent momentum but less compelling than existing SOL position.\n\n**BNB:** RSI(7) at 54.3, neutral momentum, no clear edge.\n\n**XRP:** RSI(7) at 97.1 (extremely overbought), dangerous entry point despite strong momentum.\n\n**DOGE:** RSI(7) at 61.1, neutral, no compelling setup.\n\nNo new positions warranted - focus on managing existing SOL trade.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 39.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 198.5,\n      \"stop_loss\": 188.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 188.00 or RSI(7) drops below 40 indicating momentum failure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, the momentum has deteriorated significantly:\n- RSI dropped from 73.955 to 40.717 in just 2 candles\n- Price is declining and showing weakness\n- The position is underwater by $50.56\n- RSI is dangerously close to the invalidation threshold\n\nGiven the sharp momentum loss and RSI hovering right at the invalidation level, the prudent risk management decision is to **CLOSE** this position. The invalidation condition is essentially met in spirit (momentum failure is evident), and waiting for RSI to tick below 40 could result in further losses.\n\n## Other Market Opportunities\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Extremely strong momentum: RSI(7) at 98.295 (extremely overbought)\n- Price: $2.60, up from $2.41 (consistent uptrend)\n- MACD: 0.044 and rising\n- Price well above EMA20 ($2.60 vs $2.47)\n- Volume: Above average (6.996M vs 5.587M avg)\n\n**Risk Assessment:** While XRP shows strong momentum, RSI at 98.295 is dangerously overbought. This is typically a sign of an imminent pullback or consolidation. Entering at these extreme levels carries high reversal risk.\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Price: $111,396, above EMA20 ($110,148.63)\n- RSI(7): 63.664 (healthy, not overbought)\n- MACD: 936.413 (positive and strong)\n- Recent pullback from $111,635 to $111,396\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Price: $3,933.30, above EMA20 ($3,896.14)\n- RSI(7): 57.474 (neutral/healthy)\n- MACD: 27.425 (positive)\n\n**BNB & DOGE:**\n- Both showing weakness with declining RSI and momentum\n\n**Conclusion:** Given my current underwater position in SOL with deteriorating momentum, I will close SOL to preserve capital. I will not enter new positions as XRP is extremely overbought (high reversal risk), and other coins don't present compelling risk/reward setups at this moment.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 39.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 198.5,\n      \"stop_loss\": 188.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 188.00 or RSI(7) drops below 40 indicating momentum failure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Momentum failure - RSI(7) dropped from 73.955 to 40.717 in 2 candles, hovering at invalidation threshold of 40.

High reversal risk despite momentum.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Price: $0.19726 (above EMA20: $0.19552)\n- RSI(7): 56.38 - neutral, healthy\n- MACD: 0.001 - minimal momentum\n- Volume: Below average\n- Assessment: Consolidating, no clear edge\n\n## Trading Decision Rationale\n\nGiven the current market conditions:\n\n1. **XRP** presents the most interesting but RISKY opportunity. RSI(7) at 98.46 is extremely rare and typically precedes sharp corrections. However, the strong volume and parabolic momentum could continue briefly. This is a high-risk/high-reward fade opportunity, but timing is critical.\n\n2. **BTC and ETH** are in strong uptrends but on declining volume. Without conviction volume, I'm hesitant to chase at these levels.\n\n3. **SOL** has the most balanced setup - good momentum without extreme overbought conditions.\n\n**Strategy:** I will take a CONTRARIAN position on XRP with tight risk management. The RSI(7) at 98.46 is statistically extreme and mean reversion is highly probable. I'll use a SHORT position (which I'll structure as waiting for reversal confirmation, but given the system constraints, I'll pass on this).\n\nActually, reconsidering - the system appears to be LONG-ONLY based on the structure. Given that constraint and the extreme overbought conditions across the board, the prudent decision is to **WAIT** for better entry points. All major coins are extended on low volume.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** No new positions. Market is overbought on declining volume. Better to preserve capital and wait for pullbacks or clearer setups with volume confirmation.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

Choppy price action.\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- Price: $1,116.10 (above EMA20: $1,106.82)\n- RSI(7): 57.61 - neutral\n- MACD: 9.01 - positive but declining\n- Recent action: Choppy, tested $1,103 support\n- Volume: Very low (1,172 vs avg 8,138)\n- **Assessment**: Weak momentum, declining MACD, low volume. Not attractive.\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- Price: $2.59 (above EMA20: $2.49)\n- RSI(7): 83.90 - OVERBOUGHT (was 98.6!)\n- MACD: 0.055 - positive and rising\n- Recent action: Parabolic move from $2.45 to $2.60\n- RSI(14): 87.44 - extremely overbought\n- **Assessment**: EXTREME overbought conditions. RSI was at 98.6 just candles ago. This is a blow-off top pattern. Too dangerous to enter now, likely to correct sharply.\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- Price: $0.19643 (above EMA20: $0.19542)\n- RSI(7): 43.46 - neutral/slightly bearish\n- MACD: 0.002 - flat, no momentum\n- Recent action: Declining from $0.1978, losing momentum\n- Volume: Very low (5.47M vs avg 17.3M)\n- **Assessment**: Weak momentum, declining RSI, no clear direction. Not attractive.\n\n## Trading Decision Rationale\n\nGiven the analysis:\n1. **XRP**: Too overbought to enter (RSI 83.9, was 98.6). High risk of sharp correction.\n2. **BTC**: Best setup - strong momentum, RSI cooling from extreme levels, clear uptrend. Low volume is a concern but trend is intact.\n3. **ETH**: Second best - good technicals but very low volume.\n4. **SOL/BNB/DOGE**: Weak setups, no clear edge.\n\n**Strategy**: Enter ONE position in BTC with conservative sizing due to low volume concerns. BTC has the strongest momentum and clearest trend. Will use tight stop-loss to manage risk.\n\nRisk management:\n- Position size: ~$500 risk (5% of capital)\n- Leverage: 15x (moderate given strong trend)\n- Stop-loss: Below recent swing low and EMA20\n- Profit target: Based on recent range extension\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.07,\n      \"profit_target\": 113500.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 110000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $110,000 (below EMA20 and recent support) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

This represents 85% of our planned profit capture.\n2. **Extreme overbought conditions**: RSI(7) at 86.757 and RSI(14) at 81.269 indicate severe overbought territory. This level of RSI typically precedes pullbacks.\n3. **Parabolic move**: The last candle showed a massive $1,553 spike, which often marks exhaustion moves.\n4. **Risk/Reward unfavorable**: With only $191 upside to target vs $3,309 to stop-loss, the risk/reward has deteriorated significantly.\n5. **Prudent profit-taking**: Up $109.91 on a $7,931 position (1.46% return) in just minutes. Better to lock in gains at extreme RSI levels than risk a sharp reversal.\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- **ETH**: RSI 85.973 - extremely overbought, similar parabolic move. No position, not entering at these levels.\n- **SOL**: RSI 81.663 - overbought. No position.\n- **BNB**: RSI 86.271 - extremely overbought. No position.\n- **XRP**: RSI 94.001 - DANGEROUSLY overbought (highest of all). No position.\n- **DOGE**: RSI 80.480 - overbought. No position.\n\nAll coins showing extreme overbought conditions simultaneously suggests a market-wide euphoric spike that typically reverses. This reinforces the decision to take profits on BTC rather than hold through potential correction.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.07,\n      \"profit_target\": 113500.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 110000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $110,000 (below EMA20 and recent support) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Taking profits near target ($113,309 vs $113,500 target).

While momentum is strong, entering at these levels carries significant reversal risk.\n\n**Strategy:**\nGiven the extreme overbought conditions across ALL coins, the prudent decision is to **WAIT** for a pullback or consolidation before entering new positions. The risk/reward at current levels is unfavorable:\n- Entry at tops increases stop-loss distance\n- High probability of near-term pullback\n- Better entry opportunities likely within next few candles\n\nWith no existing positions and extreme market conditions, I will **NOT ENTER ANY NEW TRADES** at this time.

The slight pullback from $2.65 to $2.63 is normal profit-taking behavior. Will continue monitoring for either profit target ($2.85) or invalidation below $2.48.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC: Extremely overbought (RSI 84.6), no position, not entering at these levels\n- ETH: RSI 65.8 after cooling from 94, but already have XRP exposure\n- SOL: RSI 51.3, neutral but no clear setup\n- BNB: RSI 93.1, dangerously overbought, avoid\n- DOGE: RSI 47.7, weak momentum, no setup\n\nNot opening new positions - maintaining focus on existing XRP trade with proper risk management.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2300.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.85,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.48,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.48 (EMA20 support) on 3-minute candle, indicating trend breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 520.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Too risky given sharp decline.\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- Price: $4,037.60 | EMA20: $4,078.32\n- RSI(7): 18.86 - **severely oversold**\n- RSI(14): 35.45 - oversold\n- MACD: 35.41 - declining rapidly\n- Dropped from $4,203 to $4,037 (-3.9%)\n- Below EMA20, showing weakness\n- Volume spike (129k vs 68k avg)\n\n**Assessment**: Extremely oversold but in downtrend.

Market showing broad weakness across all coins with oversold conditions. This suggests potential capitulation or further downside risk. Better to preserve capital and maintain the one profitable position rather than catching falling knives.\n\n---\n\n## Final Decision\n**HOLD XRP** - Only position, performing well, invalidation not triggered, above support.\n**NO NEW ENTRIES** - Market-wide weakness, oversold conditions could worsen before bouncing.

Below the EMA20 ($2.63) - showing weakness\n2. RSI at 21 indicates extreme oversold conditions\n3. Price is $0.12 above stop-loss but showing downward momentum\n4. The trend has clearly broken down from the earlier strength\n\nHowever, the invalidation condition has NOT been met yet (price still above $2.48). The extremely oversold RSI suggests potential for a bounce, but the breakdown below EMA20 and weakening MACD are concerning.\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - The specific invalidation condition ($2.48) has not been triggered. The stop-loss at $2.48 will protect against further downside. The extreme oversold RSI(7) at 21 suggests we may see a technical bounce soon. Will let the stop-loss do its job if price continues lower.\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- BTC: RSI(7) 19.5, RSI(14) 33.1 - extremely oversold, but sharp selloff from $115k to $112.8k\n- ETH: RSI(7) 11.6, RSI(14) 26.7 - extremely oversold, down from $4194 to $3978\n- SOL: RSI(7) 17.7, RSI(14) 30.9 - oversold, down from $202 to $194\n- BNB: RSI(7) 12.4, RSI(14) 25.9 - extremely oversold, crashed from $1180 to $1102\n- DOGE: RSI(7) 7.3, RSI(14) 20.4 - most oversold, down from $0.203 to $0.194\n\nAll markets are in extreme oversold territory with violent selloffs. This appears to be a broad market correction. While oversold conditions often lead to bounces, the momentum is strongly bearish across all assets. Given I'm already exposed with XRP, I will not add new positions during this volatile selloff. Better to preserve capital and wait for stabilization.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2300.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.85,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.48,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.48 (EMA20 support) on 3-minute candle, indicating trend breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 520.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price is testing EMA20 support but hasn't broken below\n2. RSI shows recovery from recent oversold conditions (was at 20.975)\n3. MACD is positive but very weak (0.003)\n4. Volume is low (1.97M vs avg 6.92M) - concerning for continuation\n5. Price action shows consolidation around EMA20\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe invalidation condition has NOT been met - price has not closed below $2.48. However, the position is showing concerning signs:\n- Trading right at EMA20 support (no cushion)\n- Very weak momentum (MACD near zero)\n- Low volume suggests lack of conviction\n- Small profit of only $43.91 (1.68%)\n\nGiven that we're 33 minutes into trading and the position is barely profitable with weak technicals, I should consider taking profits here. The risk/reward is deteriorating as price consolidates at support rather than pushing higher toward the $2.85 target.\n\nHowever, since the invalidation condition is explicitly \"closes below $2.48\" and we're at $2.63, technically the position should be held according to the rules.

Current price is $2.62, well above $2.48. The position is NOT invalidated. Stop-loss at $2.48 has not been hit.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n- Position is slightly profitable (+0.44%)\n- No invalidation condition met (price well above $2.48)\n- Stop-loss not threatened (current $2.62 vs stop $2.48)\n- RSI neutral, not showing extreme conditions\n- MACD slightly negative but stabilizing\n- Price consolidating around EMA20 support\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nWith 15x leverage on a $6,036 notional position, I'm exposed but the stop-loss provides protection. The position is performing as expected with minor profit. No immediate risk signals.\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- **BTC**: Severely oversold (RSI 21.4), down sharply to $111,510 from $114,640. MACD deeply negative (-273.78). Too risky to enter in this volatility.\n- **ETH**: Also oversold (RSI 19.7), down to $3,949.50. MACD negative (-22.6). Bearish momentum.\n- **SOL**: RSI 47.8 - neutral. MACD slightly negative. Price near EMA20. No strong signal.\n- **BNB**: Oversold (RSI 24.7), down to $1,098.90. MACD negative (-8.05). Bearish.\n- **DOGE**: Very oversold (RSI 20.3), down to $0.191. MACD negative. High risk.\n\nMarket appears to be in a correction phase across major coins. Not an ideal time to open new positions. Will hold XRP as it's showing relative strength and invalidation conditions are not met.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2300.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.85,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.48,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.48 (EMA20 support) on 3-minute candle, indicating trend breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 520.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Below EMA20 ($2.63) - showing weakness\n2. Above stop-loss ($2.48) - still has room\n3. Above invalidation level ($2.48) - NOT invalidated yet\n\nHowever, the price is dangerously close to testing the invalidation zone. The RSI at 26 shows extreme oversold conditions, which could lead to either:\n- A bounce (bullish scenario)\n- Continued breakdown through $2.48 (bearish scenario)\n\nGiven the current price is $2.59 and the invalidation is at $2.48, we have about 4.2% cushion. The position hasn't closed below $2.48 yet, so technically the invalidation condition is NOT met.\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - The invalidation condition specifically states \"closes below $2.48\" and we're currently at $2.59. The oversold RSI suggests potential for a bounce. However, I'm monitoring this very closely as we're in a vulnerable position.\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- **BTC**: RSI 16.1 (extremely oversold), price $110,675 down from $114,170. Severe selloff with MACD at -542. Too risky to enter during this capitulation.\n- **ETH**: RSI 13.6 (extremely oversold), price $3,903 down from $4,116. Similar severe selloff. Not entering.\n- **SOL**: RSI 28.3 (oversold), price $192.75 down from $202. Weakness but less severe than BTC/ETH.\n- **BNB**: RSI 40.8 (neutral-weak), price $1,106 down from $1,131. Relatively stronger but still declining.\n- **DOGE**: RSI 45.3 (neutral), price $0.1939. Most stable of the group but no clear setup.\n\nMarket-wide selloff in progress. All major coins showing weakness. Not appropriate to add new positions during this volatility. Focus on managing existing XRP position.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2300.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.85,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.48,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.48 (EMA20 support) on 3-minute candle, indicating trend breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 520.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Current price is $2.55, which is $0.07 ABOVE the invalidation level. The stop-loss has NOT been hit yet.\n\nHowever, the price is in a strong downtrend:\n- Below EMA20 ($2.62)\n- Extremely oversold RSI suggests capitulation\n- MACD turning negative\n- Price approaching stop-loss zone\n\n**Decision Rationale**:\nWhile the invalidation condition has NOT technically been met (price still above $2.48), the position is:\n1. Down 2.46% and approaching stop-loss\n2. In extreme oversold territory (RSI 16.84)\n3. Below EMA20 support\n4. Only $0.07 away from stop-loss\n\nThe extremely oversold RSI (16.84) could indicate a bounce is imminent, but the downward momentum is strong. Given we're close to stop-loss and the trend has clearly broken down, I should **CLOSE** this position for risk management rather than wait for the exact stop-loss hit.\n\n**Close Reason**: Price has broken below EMA20 support ($2.62), showing trend breakdown. Currently at $2.55 with extreme oversold conditions (RSI 16.84) and approaching stop-loss at $2.48. Closing for risk management before further deterioration.\n\n## Market Opportunities Assessment\n\n### BTC Analysis\n- Price: $110,102 | EMA20: $113,027 (below EMA)\n- RSI: 13.15 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- MACD: -711.99 - Deeply negative\n- Trend: Sharp decline from $114,350 to $110,102\n- **Assessment**: Extreme oversold but strong downtrend. Too risky to enter.\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- Price: $3,902 | EMA20: $4,032 (below EMA)\n- RSI: 13.49 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- MACD: -42.49 - Negative\n- Trend: Declining from $4,111 to $3,902\n- **Assessment**: Extreme oversold but downtrend intact. Wait for reversal confirmation.\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- Price: $193.99 | EMA20: $197.29 (below EMA)\n- RSI: 38.64 - Approaching oversold\n- MACD: -1.26 - Slightly negative\n- Recent action: Bounced from $192.75 to $193.99\n- **Assessment**: Less oversold than others, showing some resilience. Still below EMA20.\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- Price: $1,107.20 | EMA20: $1,121.28 (below EMA)\n- RSI: 41.92 - Neutral zone\n- MACD: -7.18 - Negative\n- **Assessment**: Most stable of all coins, RSI in neutral territory.\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- Price: $0.19227 | EMA20: $0.19720 (below EMA)\n- RSI: 36.78 - Approaching oversold\n- MACD: -0.003 - Negative\n- **Assessment**: Weak momentum, below EMA20.\n\n**Overall Market Assessment**: All coins are in downtrends, below their EMA20s. BTC, ETH, and XRP show extreme oversold conditions (RSI < 20), suggesting potential bounce but also indicating strong selling pressure. This is NOT a favorable environment for new long positions. The prudent action is to close the losing XRP position and wait for clearer reversal signals.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 2300.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.85,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.48,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.48 (EMA20 support) on 3-minute candle, indicating trend breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 520.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Trend breakdown confirmed - price broke below EMA20 support at $2.62 and currently at $2.55 with extreme oversold RSI (16.84).

Could see bounce from these levels but risk of further downside remains.\n\n**ETH (Ethereum)**\n- Current: $3,880.70 vs EMA20: $4,017.79 (-3.4%)\n- RSI(7): 21.8 (oversold), RSI(14): 22.9 (oversold)\n- MACD: -72.49 (negative and deteriorating)\n- Price action: Down from $4,022 to $3,880 (-3.5%)\n- Volume: Significantly below average (28,732 vs 95,815)\n- Assessment: Extremely oversold with weak volume. High probability of mean reversion bounce.\n\n**SOL (Solana)**\n- Current: $191.88 vs EMA20: $197.06 (-2.6%)\n- RSI(7): 30.7 (oversold), RSI(14): 34.9 (oversold)\n- MACD: -1.95 (negative but less severe than others)\n- Price action: Volatile with spike to $198.84 then drop to $191.88\n- Volume: Below average (409,861 vs 844,450)\n- Assessment: Least oversold of the group, showing relative strength.\n\n**BNB (Binance Coin)**\n- Current: $1,111.20 vs EMA20: $1,123.48 (-1.1%)\n- RSI(7): 44.3 (neutral), RSI(14): 41.6 (neutral)\n- MACD: -10.94 (negative but improving from -13.24)\n- Price action: Recovery from $1,098 to $1,118, now consolidating\n- Assessment: Showing best relative strength, already bouncing.\n\n**XRP**\n- Current: $2.54 vs EMA20: $2.61 (-2.7%)\n- RSI(7): 26.5 (oversold), RSI(14): 30.7 (oversold)\n- MACD: -0.017 (negative)\n- Price action: Decline from $2.65 to $2.54 (-4.2%)\n- Volume: Well below average\n- Assessment: Oversold with potential for bounce.\n\n**DOGE (Dogecoin)**\n- Current: $0.18784 vs EMA20: $0.19612 (-4.2%)\n- RSI(7): 21.2 (oversold), RSI(14): 24.8 (oversold)\n- MACD: -0.004 (negative)\n- Price action: Sharp drop from $0.1953 to $0.1878 (-3.8%)\n- Volume: Elevated (148M vs 50M avg) - high volume selloff\n- Assessment: Oversold but high volume suggests strong selling pressure.\n\n## Trading Strategy Decision\n\n**Current Position**: No open positions, $10,013.65 cash available\n\n**Market Context**: All coins are oversold (RSI < 30 on 7-period for most), presenting potential mean reversion opportunities. However, the strong bearish momentum and negative MACD readings suggest caution.\n\n**Risk Management Approach**: \n- Will enter 2-3 positions with tight stop-losses\n- Focus on coins showing strongest relative strength or deepest oversold conditions\n- Use 15x leverage for better risk/reward with smaller position sizes\n- Risk $150-200 per position (1.5-2% of capital)\n\n**Selected Trades**:\n\n1. **ETH** - Extremely oversold (RSI 21.8), high probability of bounce to EMA20 zone. Entry at current levels with tight stop below recent low.\n\n2. **BNB** - Showing relative strength with RSI at 44.3, already bouncing. Less oversold but better momentum structure.\n\n3. **SOL** - Moderate oversold condition with less severe MACD divergence. Good risk/reward setup.\n\nWill avoid BTC (too much downside momentum), XRP (weak volume), and DOGE (high volume selloff suggests more downside).\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.6,\n      \"profit_target\": 4020.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3850.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,850 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 175.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.27,\n      \"profit_target\": 1135.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1095.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,095 on 3-minute candle, breaking recent support\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 160.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.6,\n      \"profit_target\": 198.5,\n      \"stop_loss\": 188.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $188.50 on 3-minute candle, confirming bearish continuation\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 155.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

RSI(7) below 20 (extreme oversold)\n2. RSI(14) below 25 (oversold)\n3. Negative MACD with accelerating momentum\n4. Volume spikes indicating panic selling\n5. Prices well below EMA20\n\n**Opportunity Assessment:**\nWhile the market is extremely oversold and statistically due for a bounce, the momentum is still strongly negative. All MACD indicators are declining, suggesting the selling pressure hasn't exhausted yet. This is a \"falling knife\" scenario.\n\n**Risk Considerations:**\n- Catching falling knives is dangerous - momentum can continue lower\n- No clear reversal signals yet (no bullish divergence, no hammer candles)\n- Could see further 2-5% downside before bounce\n- However, RSI levels this extreme (10-16 range) rarely persist\n\n**Strategy:**\nI will initiate SMALL positions in the most oversold coins (ETH, DOGE, XRP) with:\n- Conservative leverage (10x)\n- Tight stop-losses (2-3% below entry)\n- Quick profit targets (3-5% bounce)\n- Clear invalidation: if price makes new lows\n\nThis is a mean-reversion play betting on a technical bounce, NOT a trend-following trade.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.88,\n      \"profit_target\": 3925.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3680.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price drops below 3680 (new low) or RSI(7) fails to bounce above 25 within next 30 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 815.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 18350,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.188500,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.175000,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price drops below 0.175 (new low) or fails to reclaim 0.185 within 30 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1020.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1350,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.56,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.38,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price drops below 2.38 (new low) or RSI(7) remains below 20 for more than 5 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.66,\n      \"risk_usd\": 945.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Given the momentum and RSI(7) at 6.60, this position is about to hit stop-loss\n- **DECISION**: CLOSE - Stop-loss is imminent and invalidation condition met (RSI(7) at 6.60, far from bouncing to 25)\n\n### DOGE Position\n- Entry: 0.18055, Current: 0.17684\n- Unrealized P&L: -$69.74 (-2.1%)\n- Stop-loss: 0.175 (ONLY 0.00184 AWAY - VERY CLOSE)\n- Profit target: 0.1885\n- Invalidation: \"If price drops below 0.175 (new low) or fails to reclaim 0.185 within 30 minutes\"\n- **CRITICAL**: Price at 0.17684 is only 0.00184 above stop-loss at 0.175. RSI(7) at 8.01 shows extreme weakness\n- **DECISION**: CLOSE - Stop-loss imminent, invalidation condition met (failed to reclaim 0.185, RSI extreme oversold)\n\n### XRP Position\n- Entry: 2.4523, Current: 2.383\n- Unrealized P&L: -$95.21 (-2.9%)\n- Stop-loss: 2.38 (ONLY 0.003 AWAY - TOUCHING IT)\n- Profit target: 2.56\n- Invalidation: \"If price drops below 2.38 (new low) or RSI(7) remains below 20 for more than 5 candles\"\n- **CRITICAL**: Price at 2.383 is essentially AT the stop-loss of 2.38. RSI(7) at 7.73 has been below 20 for multiple candles\n- **DECISION**: CLOSE - Stop-loss hit, invalidation condition clearly met (RSI below 20 for extended period)\n\n## Risk Management Assessment\nAll three positions are at or near their stop-losses with invalidation conditions met. The market is in extreme panic mode with RSI(7) readings in single digits across the board. This is not a \"buy the dip\" scenario when positions have clear stop-losses being hit. Proper risk management requires closing these positions to preserve capital.\n\nCurrent account value: $9,654.30 (down 3.46%)\nIf I close all positions now, I'll lock in approximately -$241 in losses but preserve $9,654 in capital for better opportunities when market stabilizes.\n\n## New Position Opportunities?\nWhile RSI levels suggest extreme oversold conditions that often precede bounces, the momentum is strongly negative with:\n- All MACD indicators deeply negative and declining\n- Prices far below EMA20\n- No signs of reversal yet\n\n**DECISION**: Do not open new positions. Wait for signs of stabilization (RSI divergence, MACD turning up, price reclaiming EMA20).\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.88,\n      \"profit_target\": 3925.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3680.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price drops below 3680 (new low) or RSI(7) fails to bounce above 25 within next 30 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 815.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Stop-loss imminent at 3680 (current 3688, only $8 away).

This represents a sharp correction from recent highs.\n\n**Individual Coin Analysis**:\n\n**BTC**: \n- Current: $108,360 vs EMA20: $111,253 (-2.6%)\n- RSI(7): 41.2 (recovering from extreme oversold 11.8)\n- MACD: -1,681 (deeply negative but stabilizing)\n- Price action: Bounced from $106,526 low to $108,360 (+1.7% recovery)\n- Assessment: Oversold bounce in progress, but still in downtrend\n\n**ETH**:\n- Current: $3,803.70 vs EMA20: $3,949.47 (-3.7%)\n- RSI(7): 43.4 (recovering from extreme 6.6)\n- MACD: -96.6 (very negative)\n- Price action: Strong bounce from $3,688 low (+3.1% recovery)\n- Assessment: Similar oversold bounce pattern to BTC\n\n**SOL**:\n- Current: $184.62 vs EMA20: $193.10 (-4.4%)\n- RSI(7): 37.9 (recovering from 10.5)\n- MACD: -3.576 (negative)\n- Price action: Bounced from $179.02 low (+3.1%)\n- Assessment: Oversold but weaker recovery than majors\n\n**BNB**:\n- Current: $1,078.20 vs EMA20: $1,108.39 (-2.7%)\n- RSI(7): 37.1 (recovering from 11.2)\n- MACD: -14.830 (negative)\n- Price action: Bounced from $1,061.20 low (+1.6%)\n- Assessment: Weakest bounce of the group\n\n**XRP**:\n- Current: $2.44 vs EMA20: $2.56 (-4.7%)\n- RSI(7): 32.8 (recovering from 7.7)\n- MACD: -0.052 (most negative relative to range)\n- Price action: Bounced from $2.38 low (+2.5%)\n- Assessment: Still very oversold, weak recovery\n\n**DOGE**:\n- Current: $0.18253 vs EMA20: $0.19160 (-4.7%)\n- RSI(7): 39.3 (recovering from 8.0)\n- MACD: -0.005 (negative)\n- Price action: Bounced from $0.17684 low (+3.2%)\n- Assessment: Decent bounce but still weak overall\n\n## Trading Decision Rationale\n\n**Current Portfolio Status**: No open positions, $9,673.07 cash available, down -3.27% overall.\n\n**Strategy**: Given the extreme oversold conditions across all assets (RSI(7) hit single digits on most coins) and the current bounce in progress, this presents a potential mean-reversion opportunity. However, the market remains in a clear downtrend with all prices below EMA20 and negative MACD readings.\n\n**Risk Considerations**:\n1. All coins are still in downtrends (below EMA20)\n2. MACD remains deeply negative across the board\n3. Bounces from extreme oversold can be short-lived\n4. Volume is below average on most coins\n\n**Trade Selection**: I will enter a small position in **ETH** as it shows:\n- Strongest RSI recovery (43.4 from 6.6)\n- Good bounce momentum (+3.1% from lows)\n- Most liquid major asset\n- Clear support level established at $3,688\n\nI'll use conservative sizing (15% of capital) with tight risk management given the uncertain market conditions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.38,\n      \"profit_target\": 3950.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3720.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,720 on 3-minute candle, indicating failed bounce and continuation of downtrend\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 318.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
