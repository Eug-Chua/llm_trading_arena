I need to analyze the market conditions for all coins and identify potential entry opportunities.\n\n## Market Analysis by Coin:\n\n**BTC (Current: $109,160)**\n- Price well below EMA20 ($111,104), indicating downtrend\n- MACD deeply negative (-1429), showing strong bearish momentum\n- RSI(7) at 43.9 - recovering from oversold but still weak\n- Recent price action: Sharp drop from $111,268 to $108,211, now bouncing to $109,160\n- Volume significantly below average (3,548 vs 7,856)\n- Assessment: In downtrend but showing signs of bottoming. RSI was at 20.8 and now recovering to 43.9. Potential bounce setup but risky.\n\n**ETH (Current: $3,930.90)**\n- Price below EMA20 ($4,023), bearish structure\n- MACD negative (-71.78), bearish momentum\n- RSI(7) at 45.5 - recovering from 21.4 oversold level\n- Similar pattern to BTC: dropped from $4,061 to $3,864, now recovering\n- Volume very low (52,185 vs 135,853)\n- Assessment: Oversold bounce in progress but weak volume suggests caution\n\n**SOL (Current: $186.91)**\n- Price significantly below EMA20 ($195.30)\n- MACD negative (-5.06), bearish\n- RSI(7) at 35.6 - recovering from extreme oversold (19.0)\n- Dropped from $197 to $184.76, now bouncing\n- Volume weak (464k vs 1.19M)\n- Assessment: Oversold but still in downtrend\n\n**BNB (Current: $1,149.30)**\n- Price well below EMA20 ($1,188)\n- MACD negative (-31.54)\n- RSI(7) at 37.8 - recovering from 13.5 extreme oversold\n- Dropped from $1,183 to $1,134, now recovering\n- Very low volume (4,336 vs 19,293)\n- Assessment: Oversold bounce but weak conviction\n\n**XRP (Current: $2.36)**\n- Price below EMA20 ($2.44)\n- MACD negative (-0.058)\n- RSI(7) at 41.5 - recovering from 20.2 oversold\n- Dropped from $2.45 to $2.33, now bouncing\n- Volume above average (13.08M vs 10.32M) - NOTABLE\n- Assessment: Best volume profile, showing relative strength\n\n**DOGE (Current: $0.19023)**\n- Price below EMA20 ($0.19826)\n- MACD negative (-0.005)\n- RSI(7) at 37.3 - recovering from 18.5 oversold\n- Dropped from $0.20026 to $0.18772, now bouncing\n- Volume very weak (16.19M vs 67.55M)\n- Assessment: Weak bounce, poor volume\n\n## Trading Decision:\n\nAll coins are in downtrends but showing oversold bounces. The market appears to be recovering from a sharp selloff. Given this is my first trade, I should:\n\n1. **Enter a position in XRP** - It has the best volume profile (above average) and is showing relative strength with RSI recovering from oversold. The bounce looks more legitimate with volume confirmation.\n\n2. **Risk Management**: With $10,000 capital, I'll risk 2% ($200) on this trade with 15x leverage for a moderate position size.\n\n3. **Entry Setup**: \n   - Entry: $2.36\n   - Stop-loss: $2.28 (below recent low of $2.33, ~3.4% below entry)\n   - Profit target: $2.50 (near EMA20 resistance, ~5.9% gain)\n   - Invalidation: If price closes below $2.30 (confirming downtrend continuation)\n\nPosition sizing: With 15x leverage and $200 risk, I can allocate ~$1,000 in margin = $15,000 notional = 6,355 XRP\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 6355,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.28,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.30 on 3-minute candle, confirming downtrend continuation\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 200\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

This is the second invocation at the start of trading, and I have no open positions with $9,211.49 available cash.\n\n### Market Conditions Overview:\n- **BTC**: Down to 105,589 from 111,268 (-5.1%), RSI(7) = 17.8 (extremely oversold), MACD deeply negative (-1386), price well below EMA20 (110,350)\n- **ETH**: Down to 3,756 from 3,979 (-5.6%), RSI(7) = 20.6 (extremely oversold), MACD = -68.5, below EMA20 (3,986)\n- **SOL**: Down to 177.65 from 194.58 (-8.7%), RSI(7) = 16.4 (extremely oversold), MACD = -5.3, below EMA20 (193.22)\n- **BNB**: Down to 1,062 from 1,163 (-8.7%), RSI(7) = 9.5 (EXTREMELY oversold - lowest), MACD = -35, below EMA20 (1,174)\n- **XRP**: Down to 2.24 from 2.40 (-6.7%), RSI(7) = 17.4 (extremely oversold), MACD = -0.059, below EMA20 (2.41)\n- **DOGE**: Down to 0.178 from 0.197 (-9.4%), RSI(7) = 14.8 (extremely oversold), MACD = -0.005, below EMA20 (0.196)\n\n### Technical Analysis:\nAll coins show:\n1. RSI(7) in extreme oversold territory (all below 21, most below 18)\n2. Prices significantly below 20-period EMA\n3. Negative MACD with increasing bearish momentum\n4. Sharp downward price action in recent candles\n5. Volume elevated above average (panic selling)\n\n### Risk Assessment:\nThis appears to be a capitulation event with extreme oversold conditions. However, the momentum is still strongly bearish with no signs of reversal yet. The safest approach is to wait for:\n- RSI divergence (price making lower lows while RSI makes higher lows)\n- MACD showing signs of bottoming\n- Price stabilization or bounce confirmation\n\n### Trading Decision:\n**NO POSITIONS** - While the oversold conditions are extreme and could present buying opportunities, the lack of any reversal signals makes this too risky. The trend is clearly down, and trying to catch a falling knife in leveraged positions could result in significant losses. Better to wait for confirmation of a bottom.\n\nGiven my -7.89% return already, I need to be extremely cautious and only enter high-probability setups with clear invalidation levels. This selloff could continue further before finding support.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

I need to analyze whether current market conditions present good entry opportunities.\n\n### Market-Wide Technical Analysis:\n\n**BTC (105,671):**\n- Price well below EMA20 (109,664) - bearish short-term trend\n- RSI(7): 19.3 - extremely oversold (below 20)\n- RSI(14): 23.5 - oversold territory\n- MACD: -1,264 and declining - strong bearish momentum\n- Price dropped from 111,288 to 105,671 (-5.0%) in last 30 minutes\n- Volume elevated (13,077 vs avg 8,416) - high selling pressure\n- This is a capitulation-style selloff\n\n**ETH (3,777):**\n- Price below EMA20 (3,943) - bearish\n- RSI(7): 27.0 - oversold\n- RSI(14): 29.9 - oversold\n- MACD: -45.7 and declining\n- Dropped from 4,061 to 3,777 (-7.0%) \n- Volume elevated significantly (253,468 vs avg 150,076)\n\n**SOL (181.47):**\n- Price below EMA20 (190.58) - bearish\n- RSI(7): 35.6 - approaching oversold\n- RSI(14): 33.6 - oversold\n- MACD: -3.55 and declining\n- Dropped from 196.80 to 177.65, now recovering to 181.47\n- Volume elevated (2.75M vs avg 1.31M)\n\n**BNB (1,071.70):**\n- Price significantly below EMA20 (1,153) - very bearish\n- RSI(7): 18.2 - extremely oversold\n- RSI(14): 20.9 - extremely oversold\n- MACD: -23.8 and declining sharply\n- Massive drop from 1,183 to 1,062 (-10.2%)\n- Most oversold of all coins\n\n**XRP (2.28):**\n- Price below EMA20 (2.39) - bearish\n- RSI(7): 35.6 - oversold\n- RSI(14): 33.4 - oversold\n- MACD: -0.042 and declining\n- Dropped from 2.45 to 2.24\n\n**DOGE (0.1826):**\n- Price below EMA20 (0.1930) - bearish\n- RSI(7): 33.7 - oversold\n- RSI(14): 31.8 - oversold\n- MACD: -0.004 and declining\n- Dropped from 0.2003 to 0.1785\n\n## Trading Decision:\n\nThis is a market-wide selloff with ALL coins showing:\n1. Extremely oversold RSI conditions (especially BTC and BNB)\n2. Prices below EMA20\n3. Negative and declining MACD\n4. Elevated volume on the downside\n\n**Strategy:** This presents a potential mean-reversion opportunity. When RSI(7) drops below 20 (BTC: 19.3, BNB: 18.2), it often signals capitulation and potential bounce. However, the momentum is still strongly bearish with declining MACD across all assets.\n\n**Risk Assessment:** Given my -7.89% drawdown, I need to be cautious. The safest play is to wait for signs of stabilization (RSI divergence, MACD turning up, price reclaiming EMA20) before entering.\n\n**Decision:** I will enter ONE position on BTC as it shows the most extreme oversold condition (RSI 19.3) and is the most liquid/stable asset. I'll use tight risk management with a 15x leverage position sizing for ~$500 risk (5.4% of account).\n\nEntry rationale for BTC:\n- RSI(7) at 19.3 is extreme oversold (typically bounces from sub-20 levels)\n- Price at 105,671 vs EMA20 at 109,664 = 3.6% discount\n- MACD at -1,264 is extended, likely to mean-revert\n- Will set tight stop-loss below recent low at 105,000\n- Profit target at EMA20 (109,664) for 3.8% gain\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.07,\n      \"profit_target\": 109664.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 104500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 104,500 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued breakdown rather than oversold bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 550.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The invalidation condition has NOT been met.\n\n**Technical Assessment:**\n- The sharp selloff appears to be stabilizing with RSI recovering from extreme oversold (17.86 \u2192 39.58)\n- Price found support around 105,500-105,600 zone and is attempting to bounce\n- MACD remains deeply negative (-1,257) but the rate of decline is slowing\n- Volume elevated (10,268 vs avg 8,437) suggesting active participation\n- Still trading below EMA20, indicating the downtrend is intact but potentially exhausting\n\n**Risk Analysis:**\n- Current price 106,821 provides ~2.2% cushion above stop-loss (104,500)\n- Need ~2.7% move up to hit profit target (109,664)\n- Position is slightly profitable (+$76.80) after initial adverse move\n- The bounce from extreme oversold levels suggests potential for mean reversion\n\n**Decision: HOLD**\n- Invalidation condition NOT met (price above 104,500)\n- RSI showing recovery from extreme oversold levels\n- Small profit developing, risk/reward still favorable\n- Stop-loss provides adequate protection if breakdown continues\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**ETH:** No position. Price 3,797 below EMA20 (3,928), RSI 33.9 oversold, MACD -49.57. Similar bearish pattern to BTC but no existing position to manage.\n\n**SOL:** No position. Price 182.74 below EMA20 (189.96), RSI 41.6 recovering from 16.4, showing bounce potential but no position.\n\n**BNB:** No position. Price 1,074 significantly below EMA20 (1,142), RSI 20.75 extremely oversold. Severe weakness but no position.\n\n**XRP:** No position. Price 2.30 below EMA20 (2.38), RSI 42.8 recovering. No position to manage.\n\n**DOGE:** No position. Price 0.18475 below EMA20 (0.19237), RSI 42.5 recovering. No position.\n\n**New Position Consideration:**\nGiven we're only 1 minute into trading with -7.10% drawdown, and BTC position is starting to recover, I should focus on managing existing risk rather than adding new positions.

However, I need to consider:\n1. Price remains below EMA20 (bearish structure)\n2. MACD still deeply negative (downtrend intact)\n3. RSI showing recovery but not strong momentum\n4. Price is 2,622 points away from profit target (109,664)\n5. Only 1,542 points above stop-loss\n\nThe risk/reward is concerning - we're closer to stop-loss than profit target. The broader trend remains bearish with price below EMA20 and negative MACD. The recent bounce could be a dead-cat bounce rather than a reversal.\n\n**Risk Management Consideration:**\nGiven the weak technical setup and the fact we're in a downtrend, I should consider taking the small profit rather than risking a reversal. The invalidation condition hasn't been met, but the technical picture suggests limited upside.\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION**\nReason: Taking profits in weak technical environment. Price remains below EMA20, MACD deeply negative, and risk/reward unfavorable. Better to preserve capital and wait for clearer setup.\n\n**Other Coins (ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE):**\n- No existing positions\n- All showing similar bearish structure (below EMA20, negative MACD)\n- Not entering new trades in current weak market conditions\n- Will not include these in JSON output\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.07,\n      \"profit_target\": 109664.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 104500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 104,500 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 550.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Taking profits in weak technical environment - price remains below EMA20 (108,843), MACD deeply negative (-1,620), and risk/reward unfavorable with limited upside potential in current downtrend\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The market just experienced a flash crash across all assets, and we're seeing recovery bounces.\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. All coins are below their EMA20, indicating bearish structure\n2. Low volume across the board suggests weak conviction\n3. RSI readings show recovery momentum, especially in ETH, BNB, and XRP\n4. MACD values are all negative but improving\n\n**Best opportunity:** ETH shows the strongest technical setup:\n- RSI(7) at 66.49 with RSI(14) crossing above 50\n- MACD improving rapidly\n- Price only $23 below EMA20 (closest to breakout)\n- Clear support at $3,756 (recent low)\n\nI'll take a conservative position in ETH with tight risk management. The invalidation will be if price breaks back below the recent low, indicating the recovery is failing.\n\n**Risk management:**\n- Position size: ~$3,000 exposure (32% of capital)\n- Leverage: 15x (moderate)\n- Risk: ~$200 (2.2% of capital)\n- Stop-loss: Below recent swing low with buffer\n- Profit target: Above EMA20 and targeting previous resistance\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.52,\n      \"profit_target\": 3965.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3850.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,850 on 3-minute candle, indicating recovery failure and continuation of downtrend\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 215.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The price has bounced from $3,756 and is now consolidating around $3,880. RSI shows neutral momentum with slight bullish bias (59.98), and MACD is improving. The position is only down $6.58 (-0.27%), which is minimal. The invalidation condition has NOT been triggered as price remains above $3,850. The stop-loss provides adequate protection at $3,850.\n\n**Conclusion:** HOLD the ETH position. The invalidation condition is not met, technical indicators show potential for recovery, and the risk/reward remains favorable with stop-loss protection in place.\n\n**Other Coins:**\nNo positions in BTC, SOL, BNB, XRP, or DOGE. Market conditions show mixed signals across the board with most coins still below their EMAs and in recovery phases.

Price is consolidating above stop-loss with improving MACD momentum. The bounce from $3,825 to $3,904 shows buying interest. Current pullback to $3,886 is normal consolidation. No exit conditions triggered.\n\n## Market Opportunities Assessment\n\n### BTC\n- Price: $106,726 below EMA20 ($107,771) - downtrend\n- RSI: 36.17 (oversold territory)\n- MACD: -942.47 (deeply negative, but improving from -967.87)\n- Recent action: Sharp drop from $107,215 to $106,726\n- **Assessment**: Oversold but in downtrend. Too risky to enter without confirmation of reversal.\n\n### SOL\n- Price: $185.81 below EMA20 ($186.66) - slight weakness\n- RSI: 47.79 (neutral)\n- MACD: -1.40 (improving)\n- Recent action: Pullback from $187.47 to $185.81\n- **Assessment**: Neutral setup, no clear edge.\n\n### BNB\n- Price: $1,083.90 well below EMA20 ($1,110.92) - downtrend\n- RSI: 35.47 (oversold)\n- MACD: -20.89 (negative)\n- Recent action: Failed rally, now declining\n- **Assessment**: Weak, avoid.\n\n### XRP\n- Price: $2.35 at EMA20 ($2.35) - equilibrium\n- RSI: 45.27 (neutral)\n- MACD: -0.010 (near zero, improving)\n- Recent action: Consolidating tightly\n- **Assessment**: No clear directional bias.\n\n### DOGE\n- Price: $0.18869 below EMA20 ($0.18919) - slight weakness\n- RSI: 50.62 (neutral)\n- MACD: -0.001 (nearly flat, improving)\n- Recent action: Pullback from $0.19053 to $0.18869\n- **Assessment**: Neutral, no compelling setup.\n\n## Risk Management Review\n- Current account value: $9,291.30\n- Available cash: $9,160.41\n- Total return: -7.09%\n- Single position (ETH) with $2,020.72 notional at 15x leverage\n- Position size is reasonable at ~22% of account value in notional exposure\n- Sharpe ratio: -15.215 (poor, but early in trading period)\n\n## Conclusion\nOnly ETH position is active and remains valid.

Price is above entry, above EMA20, and showing bullish technical signals. The invalidation condition has not been triggered. RSI is elevated but not at extreme levels that would warrant immediate exit. MACD is improving.

RSI(7) 68.9 showing strength. MACD improving. However, already have ETH exposure and don't want to over-leverage with 15x positions.\n\n**SOL:** Price $188.86, above EMA20 ($186.78). RSI(7) 72.3 overbought. Strong momentum but already extended.\n\n**BNB:** Price $1,099.20, below EMA20 ($1,109.84). RSI(7) 57.8 neutral. MACD still negative. Weak setup.\n\n**XRP:** Price $2.37, above EMA20 ($2.35). RSI(7) 63.3. Consolidating but no clear edge.\n\n**DOGE:** Price $0.193210, above EMA20 ($0.189724). RSI(7) 77.4 very overbought. Extended move, risky entry.\n\n**Conclusion:** No new positions warranted.

High probability of near-term pullback. Too risky to enter now.\n\n**XRP:** RSI(7) at 72 - overbought but not extreme. However, MACD barely positive suggests weak momentum.\n\n**BNB:** RSI(7) at 69.4, approaching overbought. MACD still negative. Mixed signals, not compelling.\n\n**SOL:** Best risk/reward setup:\n- RSI(7): 58.5 - healthy, room to run\n- RSI(14): 59.5 - not overbought\n- MACD: 0.664 - positive and rising\n- Price above EMA20 with good momentum\n- Recent pullback from 190.67 to 188.81 provides better entry\n- Lower volatility (ATR: 4.04) compared to others\n\n**Decision:** Enter SOL position with conservative sizing given my negative performance. Use 15x leverage to balance risk/reward, with tight stop-loss to protect capital.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 7.4,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 184.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 184.00 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 40 indicating momentum reversal\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 532.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

RSI shows strength without extreme overbought conditions (70 vs 90+ seen in BTC/ETH). MACD is positive and trending up. Price is comfortably above both the stop-loss and invalidation levels. The profit target at $195.50 is achievable given the current momentum. No reason to exit prematurely.\n\n**Other Coins Assessment:**\n- **BTC**: RSI(7) at 86.833 - extremely overbought, risky entry\n- **ETH**: RSI(7) at 90.328 - dangerously overbought, avoid\n- **BNB**: RSI(7) at 73.779 - overbought, MACD still negative\n- **XRP**: RSI(7) at 80.881 - overbought\n- **DOGE**: RSI(7) at 81.814 - overbought\n\nAll major coins are showing overbought conditions.

The price is approaching the profit target of 195.50 (only 2.57 points away). However, the invalidation conditions have NOT been triggered:\n1. Price remains well above 184.00 (current: 192.93)\n2. RSI(7) at 77.159 is still strong, nowhere near the 40 threshold\n\nWhile RSI is elevated at 77, this doesn't trigger our invalidation condition. The momentum remains positive with MACD increasing and price above EMA. The position is close to profit target, suggesting we should hold to capture the remaining upside rather than exit prematurely.\n\n**Risk Assessment**:\n- Position is in profit, reducing overall portfolio risk\n- Stop loss provides 4.63% downside protection\n- Leverage at 15x is manageable given the profit buffer\n- No signs of immediate reversal\n\n### Market Overview for Other Coins\n\n**BTC**: RSI(7) at 91.207 - Extremely overbought, but strong momentum. Price at 111,161 with positive MACD. No position currently.\n\n**ETH**: RSI(7) at 92.913 - Extremely overbought. Strong uptrend but extended. No position currently.\n\n**XRP**: RSI(7) at 87.651 - Very overbought. Strong momentum but risky entry point. No position currently.\n\n**DOGE**: RSI(7) at 86.119 - Very overbought. Extended move. No position currently.\n\n**BNB**: RSI(7) at 67.344 - More moderate, but MACD still negative. Less attractive. No position currently.\n\n**New Position Considerations**:\nAll major coins are showing extremely overbought RSI readings (87-92 range), which typically signals exhaustion and potential reversal risk. Given we're only 8 minutes into trading with a -6.31% return, taking new positions at these extreme levels would be imprudent risk management. Better to hold our profitable SOL position and wait for better entry opportunities.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 7.4,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.5,\n      \"stop_loss\": 184.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 184.00 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 40 indicating momentum reversal\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 532.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The RSI has cooled from overbought levels (77.6 earlier) to neutral (50.5), which is healthy consolidation. Price is still above the 20-EMA (187.66) and MACD remains positive. The pullback from 192.93 to 190.41 appears to be normal profit-taking rather than a reversal. \n\nHowever, I'm concerned about:\n1. The RSI dropping from 77.6 to 50.5 rapidly - momentum is fading\n2. Price rejected at 192.93 and pulling back\n3. We're only up $11 on a $1,409 position (0.79% gain)\n4. The position has 15x leverage, making it risky\n\nGiven that the invalidation conditions are NOT met and we're still in a valid setup, I should HOLD. The stop-loss at 184.0 provides adequate protection, and the profit target at 195.5 is still achievable if momentum returns.\n\n### Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC**: \n- Extremely overbought (RSI 86.5)\n- Strong uptrend but at 111,100 after a massive rally\n- Too risky to enter at these extended levels\n\n**ETH**:\n- RSI(7) dropped from 93.8 to 52.5 - sharp momentum loss\n- Price at 4003.10 after peaking at 4053.40\n- Showing signs of exhaustion after overbought conditions\n\n**BNB**:\n- RSI(7) at 43.9, showing weakness\n- Price pulling back from 1127.90 to 1110.10\n- Not compelling for entry\n\n**XRP**:\n- RSI(7) at 77.2 - overbought\n- Strong rally from 2.35 to 2.47\n- Too extended for safe entry\n\n**DOGE**:\n- RSI(7) at 65.0, cooling from overbought\n- Price at 0.199280 after rally\n- Not ideal entry point\n\n**Conclusion**: No new positions warranted.

I need to analyze whether current market conditions present good entry opportunities.\n\n### Market Overview:\nAll major coins are showing significant pullbacks from recent highs:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $108,019 vs EMA20: $108,879 (below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 18.02 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 35.28 - Oversold territory\n- MACD: 691.8 declining rapidly from 1003.97\n- Price dropped from $111,161 to $108,019 in last 30 minutes\n- This is a sharp correction after overbought conditions (RSI was 91.88)\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,891.90 vs EMA20: $3,945.06 (below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 14.59 - EXTREMELY oversold (lowest of all coins)\n- RSI(14): 30.72 - Oversold\n- MACD: 19.76 declining from 40.07\n- Dropped from $4,053 to $3,891 rapidly\n- Severe oversold condition suggests potential bounce\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $184.93 vs EMA20: $187.86 (below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 22.17 - Very oversold\n- RSI(14): 34.60 - Oversold\n- MACD: 0.615 declining\n- Relatively smaller pullback compared to others\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,071.30 vs EMA20: $1,099.19 (significantly below)\n- RSI(7): 11.74 - MOST EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 26.74 - Very oversold\n- MACD: -0.513 (negative, bearish)\n- Dropped from $1,127.90 to $1,071.30\n- Most oversold condition suggests potential reversal\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.43 vs EMA20: $2.42 (slightly above EMA)\n- RSI(7): 35.45 - Approaching oversold\n- RSI(14): 47.79 - Neutral\n- MACD: 0.032 still positive\n- Holding up better than others, above EMA\n- Relative strength compared to market\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.19416 vs EMA20: $0.19476 (slightly below)\n- RSI(7): 22.81 - Very oversold\n- RSI(14): 41.28 - Approaching oversold\n- MACD: 0.003 still positive\n- Sharp pullback from $0.20115\n\n## Trading Decision Rationale:\n\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions across the board (RSI(7) below 25 for BTC, ETH, BNB, DOGE), this presents potential mean reversion opportunities. However, I need to be cautious:\n\n**Pros for entering:**\n- Extreme RSI readings historically precede bounces\n- Sharp selloffs often create V-shaped recoveries\n- Multiple coins showing coordinated oversold signals\n\n**Cons/Risks:**\n- Could be start of larger correction\n- No clear reversal signals yet (no bullish divergence)\n- MACD still declining on most coins\n- Volume spike suggests panic selling\n\n**Strategy:** I'll enter selective positions on the most oversold coins with tight stop-losses, targeting quick mean reversion bounces. Focus on BNB (RSI 11.74) and ETH (RSI 14.59) as they show the most extreme oversold conditions.\n\n**Risk Management:**\n- Use 15x leverage for better risk/reward on mean reversion\n- Risk $400-500 per position (4-5% of capital)\n- Tight stop-losses below recent lows\n- Quick profit targets at EMA20 levels\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.07,\n      \"profit_target\": 1099.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1060.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,060 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 20 within next 15 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 450.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.12,\n      \"profit_target\": 3945.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3870.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,870 or makes new lower low below $3,880\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.70,\n      \"risk_usd\": 450.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

All coins just experienced massive synchronized spikes (4-5%+ in 3 minutes), which suggests:\n1. Potential news event or market-wide catalyst\n2. High probability of mean reversion/pullback\n3. Entering at these levels = buying the top of a spike\n\n**Strategy:**\n- **DO NOT CHASE** - All assets are overbought after parabolic moves\n- Wait for pullback or consolidation before entering\n- The synchronized nature of the moves suggests this could be a short squeeze or news-driven spike\n- Better to miss the move than to buy the top and get stopped out again\n\nGiven the extreme overbought conditions across all coins and the fact that we're seeing 5%+ moves in a single 3-minute candle after already being in uptrends, the prudent decision is to **STAY IN CASH** and wait for better entry opportunities.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

Given:\n- Only $4.66 buffer to stop-loss\n- Broad market weakness\n- Declining momentum (MACD falling)\n- High leverage (15x) amplifying risk\n- Already down 4.5%\n\n**DECISION: CLOSE POSITION** - Risk management dictates exiting this position. We're too close to stop-loss with deteriorating market conditions. Better to take a controlled loss now than risk hitting stop-loss or worse, liquidation. The invalidation level is nearly breached, and with 15x leverage, any further downside could be catastrophic.\n\n### Other Coins Assessment\n- **BTC**: RSI 36.103 (oversold), below EMA20, MACD declining - Bearish\n- **ETH**: RSI 33.850 (oversold), below EMA20, MACD declining - Bearish  \n- **BNB**: RSI 27.847 (deeply oversold), MACD negative - Very bearish\n- **XRP**: RSI 36.136 (oversold), slight MACD positive - Neutral/bearish\n- **DOGE**: RSI 34.868 (oversold), below EMA20 - Bearish\n\nAll coins are showing oversold conditions, but in a strong downtrend, oversold can stay oversold. No clear reversal signals yet.

Recent sharp drops from local highs\n\n**Strategy**: The market is showing oversold conditions across the board after a sharp selloff. However, the trend remains bearish with all coins below their EMA20 and MACD showing negative or weakening momentum. \n\nGiven my -11% drawdown and the uncertain market conditions, I will look for a high-probability mean reversion setup. **DOGE** shows the most oversold RSI(7) at 29.10, suggesting a potential bounce. However, the overall bearish structure makes this risky.\n\n**Decision**: WAIT for clearer signals. The oversold conditions could lead to a bounce, but entering now against the trend with declining MACD is high risk. I'll preserve capital and wait for either:\n- A confirmed reversal (price back above EMA20 with positive MACD)\n- Or deeper oversold conditions with bullish divergence\n\nWith only 14 minutes of trading and already down 11%, risk management is paramount. No trades at this time.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

Risk of further downside.\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- Current: $3,827.60 vs EMA20: $3,924.15 (trading below EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 28.25 - DEEPLY OVERSOLD\n- RSI(14): 34.97 - oversold\n- MACD: -11.28 (negative and declining)\n- Price dropped from $4,082.90 to $3,827.60 (-6.2%)\n- Most oversold of all coins - highest bounce potential\n\n**Assessment**: Best oversold bounce candidate. RSI(7) at 28.25 is extreme.\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- Current: $184.99 vs EMA20: $187.77 (slightly below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 34.98 - oversold but not extreme\n- RSI(14): 40.83 - neutral/slightly oversold\n- MACD: -0.179 (slightly negative)\n- Dropped from $196.14 to $184.99 (-5.7%)\n\n**Assessment**: Oversold but less extreme than BTC/ETH.\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- Current: $1,068.70 vs EMA20: $1,085.93 (below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 40.33 - approaching oversold\n- RSI(14): 40.68 - neutral\n- MACD: -5.915 (negative)\n- Dropped from $1,111.50 to $1,068.70 (-3.8%)\n\n**Assessment**: Weakest oversold signal.

High bounce potential but also high volatility risk.\n\n## Trading Strategy Decision\n\nGiven the severe oversold conditions across the board, this presents a potential mean-reversion opportunity. However, my poor Sharpe ratio (-11.854) suggests I need to be more selective and risk-conscious.\n\n**Best Opportunities (ranked by risk/reward):**\n1. **ETH** - RSI(7) 28.25, strong oversold, large cap stability\n2. **DOGE** - RSI(7) 26.21, most oversold but higher volatility\n3. **XRP** - RSI(7) 28.03, oversold with positive MACD\n\n**Decision**: Enter ONE position in ETH for mean-reversion bounce. ETH offers:\n- Extreme oversold (RSI 28.25)\n- Large cap = lower volatility than DOGE\n- Clear support levels for stop-loss\n- Better liquidity\n\n**Position Sizing**: With $8,893.73 available and poor performance, I'll risk 2% ($178) on this trade.\n- Leverage: 15x (moderate for mean-reversion)\n- Entry: $3,827.60\n- Stop-loss: $3,750 (2% below current, below recent low)\n- Profit target: $3,980 (4% gain, back to EMA20 area)\n- Risk: ~$178 (2% of capital)\n\n**Invalidation**: If price closes below $3,750 or RSI(7) drops below 20 (extreme panic).\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.35,\n      \"profit_target\": 3980.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3750.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,750 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 20\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 178.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, the invalidation conditions are NOT met:\n1. Price is still $89 above the stop-loss level\n2. RSI(7) is well above 20 at 33.441\n\nWhile the MACD is deeply negative (-22.863) and price is below EMA20, these are not part of my invalidation criteria. The position was entered with specific exit rules, and I must honor them. The RSI is showing signs of bottoming (was 28.172, now 33.441), suggesting potential stabilization.\n\n**Risk Management:**\n- Current drawdown: -11.03%\n- Available cash: $8,803.75\n- Position represents small portion of portfolio\n- No reason to exit prematurely when invalidation not triggered\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC, SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE: All showing weakness with prices below EMA20, negative MACD trends, and low RSI readings. Market appears to be in consolidation/correction phase.

Price is holding above $3,750 and RSI(7) is at 55.381, well above the 20 threshold. The recent price action shows a recovery bounce with RSI improving from deeply oversold levels. MACD is improving (less negative), suggesting potential momentum shift.\n\nHowever, price remains below EMA20 ($3,903.06), indicating we're still in a corrective phase. The profit target at $3,980 requires a +$116.90 move (+3.0%), which is achievable but not imminent given current consolidation.\n\n**Risk Management:**\n- Current account value: $8,905.65 (down -10.94% overall)\n- Available cash: $8,803.75\n- Position size: $1,352.08 notional (reasonable for account size)\n- Stop loss provides adequate protection at $3,750\n\n**Conclusion:** HOLD the ETH position. The invalidation condition is not met, technical indicators show improvement from oversold levels, and the position has a reasonable risk/reward setup. No reason to exit prematurely.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC: No position, price consolidating around $109,263 with improving RSI but still below EMA20\n- SOL: No position, strong recovery with RSI(7) at 71.136 but already extended\n- BNB: No position, recovering but RSI(7) at 58.310 after spike to 79.214\n- XRP: No position, weak with RSI(7) at 45.890 and below EMA20\n- DOGE: No position, consolidating with RSI(7) at 57.158\n\nGiven the current drawdown (-10.94%) and existing ETH exposure, I will not open new positions.

We're within 1% of profit target with extreme overbought conditions (RSI 83.272). The risk of a reversal from these overbought levels outweighs waiting for the final $29.90. This is prudent risk management - locking in a 3.2% gain rather than risking a pullback.\n\n### Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC**: \n- RSI(7): 84.563 - Extremely overbought\n- Strong uptrend but overextended\n- No position, not entering at these extreme levels\n\n**SOL**:\n- RSI(7): 84.992 - Most overbought of all coins\n- Price $192.09 vs EMA20 $187.77\n- Too extended for new entry\n\n**BNB**:\n- RSI(7): 59.644 - More reasonable but still elevated\n- MACD positive at 12.138\n- Not compelling enough for new position\n\n**XRP**:\n- RSI(7): 76.650 - Overbought\n- Weak MACD at -0.010\n- Pass on entry\n\n**DOGE**:\n- RSI(7): 74.313 - Overbought\n- Weak momentum\n- No entry signal\n\n**Overall Market Assessment**: All major coins showing overbought RSI(7) readings (74-85 range), suggesting market-wide exhaustion. This is NOT the time to open new positions.

Looking at the recent candles, the lowest was $189.29, which is ABOVE $189.00.

Risk/reward favorable with $5 downside vs $5 upside to target\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** Strong momentum (RSI 67, MACD positive 36.741, price above EMA). However, already have SOL position at 15x leverage using significant capital. Not adding new positions.\n\n**ETH:** Neutral momentum (MACD still negative -6.397, RSI 63). Not compelling enough for new entry.\n\n**BNB:** Weak momentum (RSI 41.867, declining from highs). Not attractive.\n\n**XRP:** Extremely overbought (RSI 92.379). Too risky to enter at these levels.\n\n**DOGE:** Moderate momentum (RSI 68, MACD slightly negative). Not compelling.\n\n**Portfolio Risk:** Currently using ~$60k notional on $9k account value (6.7x effective leverage).

The lowest recent price was $189.29, which did not close below $189.00. Invalidation condition is NOT met.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Position is profitable but using 15x leverage on a volatile asset\n- RSI shows overbought conditions on both timeframes\n- Low volume compared to average suggests weakening momentum\n- Price is only $5.38 away from profit target ($198.50)\n- Price is $5.38 away from stop-loss ($188.50)\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe SOL position is profitable and the invalidation condition has not been met. However, I'm concerned about:\n1. Overbought RSI on both 7 and 14-period (73.9 and 72.0)\n2. Volume significantly below average (48% of normal)\n3. High leverage (15x) increases risk\n4. We're in profit and could lock in gains\n\nGiven the overbought conditions and low volume, there's risk of a pullback. However, the invalidation condition is clear and has not been triggered. The momentum indicators (MACD rising, price above EMA) remain positive.\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - The invalidation condition has not been met, and the technical setup remains intact despite overbought readings. Will maintain position with existing stop-loss and profit target.\n\n## Other Coins Analysis\n\n**BTC:** RSI 77.9 (very overbought), strong uptrend but extended. No position, not entering at these levels.\n\n**ETH:** RSI 58.6 (neutral), MACD positive but modest. Consolidating. No compelling entry.\n\n**BNB:** RSI 48.1 (neutral), losing momentum. MACD declining. No position, no entry signal.\n\n**XRP:** RSI 95.6 (EXTREMELY overbought), parabolic move. Dangerous to enter. No position.\n\n**DOGE:** RSI 70.7 (overbought), modest gains. No compelling setup. No position.\n\n**Portfolio Status:** Down -8.26% overall.

Momentum has clearly weakened (RSI dropped from 74 to 52 in one candle)\n2. Price came dangerously close to invalidation ($189.29 vs $189.00 threshold)\n3. High leverage (15x) amplifies risk in weakening conditions\n4. Small loss (-$126) is manageable - better to preserve capital\n5. Price action showing indecision after failing to hold $193+ levels\n\n## Other Opportunities\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Extremely strong momentum: RSI 97.07 (massively overbought)\n- Price: $2.56, up from $2.39 (7% move in 30 minutes)\n- MACD: 0.036 and rising consistently\n- Price well above EMA20 ($2.56 vs $2.46)\n- **TOO OVERBOUGHT** - RSI above 95 is extreme, high probability of pullback\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- RSI: 79.31 (overbought but not extreme)\n- Strong uptrend: Price $111,635 vs EMA20 $110,135\n- MACD: 795.17 and rising\n- Momentum intact but entering overbought territory\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- RSI: 65.63 (neutral to slightly bullish)\n- Price: $3,941 vs EMA20 $3,898\n- MACD: 20.17 and rising\n- Most balanced technical setup\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- RSI: 54.33 (neutral)\n- Price: $1,115.10 vs EMA20 $1,104.94\n- MACD: 10.13 but declining\n- Weak momentum\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- RSI: 61.13 (neutral)\n- Price: $0.19747 vs EMA20 $0.19524\n- MACD: 0.002 (minimal momentum)\n- Sideways action\n\n**Trading Decision:** Close SOL to preserve capital and avoid further risk in weakening momentum.

The price is currently $192.91, which is $1.91 above the stop-loss level of $191.00. While the position is slightly underwater, the technical structure remains intact:\n1. Price is above the 20-period EMA (bullish)\n2. MACD is positive (momentum still bullish)\n3. RSI shows room for upside movement\n4. The recent dip to $191.76 held above the $191.00 invalidation level\n\n**Decision: HOLD**\nThe invalidation condition requires a close BELOW $191.00. Current price is $192.91, well above this level. The technical indicators suggest the uptrend structure is still intact. The position should be held as planned.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** Price $111,271, strong uptrend but RSI dropped sharply to 44.9 from 72.8 - showing pullback. Price above EMA20. No position, not entering during pullback.\n\n**ETH:** Price $3,931.30, RSI dropped to 43.9 from 67.5 - pullback in progress. Price above EMA20 but momentum weakening. No position, avoiding.\n\n**BNB:** Price $1,116.60, RSI 58.9, MACD declining. Modest uptrend but not compelling. No position.\n\n**XRP:** Price $2.60, RSI extremely overbought at 85.8 (14-period at 88.8). Parabolic move but dangerous to chase. No position, avoiding overbought conditions.\n\n**DOGE:** Price $0.1949, RSI crashed to 27.8 - oversold. Price below EMA20. Weak momentum. No position, avoiding weakness.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 7.8,\n      \"profit_target\": 200.5,\n      \"stop_loss\": 191.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $191.00 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown of recent support\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Taking profits at +2.82% with $544 gain is excellent execution. The risk of holding for an additional $1.61 in a severely overbought market outweighs the potential reward.\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- **BTC**: RSI 92.759 - extremely overbought, no position\n- **ETH**: RSI 94.042 - dangerously overbought, no position  \n- **BNB**: RSI 83.345 - overbought, no position\n- **XRP**: RSI 59.805 - neutral, but already extended\n- **DOGE**: RSI 84.698 - overbought, no position\n\nAll coins showing extreme overbought conditions.

While momentum is strong, these extreme overbought conditions typically lead to sharp corrections. The risk/reward is unfavorable for new longs here.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Price: $4,203.80\n- RSI(7): 92.44 - Extremely overbought\n- RSI(14): 88.23 - Also extremely overbought\n- MACD: 67.03 - Strong positive\n- Price vs EMA20: $4,203 vs $4,021 = 4.5% premium\n- Similar parabolic pattern to BTC\n\n**Risk Assessment:** Same extreme overbought conditions as BTC. Not a good entry point.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Price: $202.49\n- RSI(7): 70.26 - Overbought but not extreme\n- RSI(14): 72.16 - Moderately overbought\n- MACD: 2.62 - Positive momentum\n- Price vs EMA20: $202.49 vs $196.28 = 3.2% premium\n- Recent pullback from $204.39 to $202.49\n\n**Risk Assessment:** Less extreme than BTC/ETH but still elevated. The pullback from $204.39 shows some profit-taking.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Price: $1,156.70\n- RSI(7): 86.12 - Very overbought\n- RSI(14): 78.11 - Overbought\n- MACD: 4.18 - Positive and accelerating\n- Price vs EMA20: $1,156.70 vs $1,129.94 = 2.4% premium\n\n**Risk Assessment:** Overbought but less extreme than BTC/ETH. Showing strong momentum.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Price: $2.63\n- RSI(7): 54.74 - Neutral (most balanced of all coins)\n- RSI(14): 66.46 - Slightly overbought but healthy\n- MACD: 0.054 - Positive\n- Price vs EMA20: $2.63 vs $2.57 = 2.3% premium\n- Consolidating after recent rally\n\n**Risk Assessment:** This is the ONLY coin not in extreme overbought territory. RSI(7) at 54.74 suggests room to run. Price consolidating rather than parabolic.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Price: $0.206130\n- RSI(7): 76.22 - Overbought\n- RSI(14): 74.75 - Overbought\n- MACD: 0.002 - Positive\n- Price vs EMA20: $0.206 vs $0.200 = 3.1% premium\n\n**Risk Assessment:** Overbought but not extreme.\n\n## Trading Decision\n\nGiven my poor performance (-6.97%) and the need to recover, I need to be selective. The market is in a strong uptrend but most coins are at extreme overbought levels (RSI > 90), which historically leads to sharp corrections.\n\n**XRP stands out as the ONLY opportunity:**\n- RSI(7) at 54.74 is neutral - not overbought\n- RSI(14) at 66.46 is healthy\n- Price consolidating at $2.63 after testing $2.65\n- Strong uptrend with EMA20 rising\n- MACD positive and stable\n- Volume elevated (13.27M vs 5.26M average)\n\nI will enter a conservative long position on XRP with tight risk management:\n- Entry: $2.63\n- Stop-loss: $2.55 (below recent consolidation and EMA20)\n- Profit target: $2.75 (4.6% gain, conservative given market conditions)\n- Risk: ~$300 (3.2% of capital)\n- Leverage: 15x (moderate given the setup quality)\n\n**Invalidation condition:** If price closes below $2.55 on a 3-minute candle, it would break below the EMA20 support and signal the uptrend is failing.\n\nAll other coins are too overbought to enter safely.

Price is consolidating after a strong move, which is healthy. The RSI has cooled from overbought levels (was 94+, now 50), suggesting the pullback was just profit-taking. Price remains above EMA20 support and well above the stop-loss. The MACD is still positive, indicating uptrend intact.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Position size: $4,489 notional (15x leverage on ~$300 risk)\n- Stop-loss distance: $0.08 or 3% from current price\n- Profit target distance: $0.12 or 4.6% from current price\n- Risk/reward ratio remains favorable\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC: RSI 84.6 - extremely overbought, no position, not entering at these levels\n- ETH: RSI 65.8 - cooling from overbought, but no clear setup\n- SOL: RSI 51.3 - neutral, consolidating, no compelling entry\n- BNB: RSI 93.1 - dangerously overbought, avoid\n- DOGE: RSI 47.7 - neutral, weak momentum\n\n**Conclusion:**\nHOLD XRP position.

Price at $113,903 after sharp drop from $115,566. Too risky to enter after such volatility.\n- **ETH**: RSI at 31.908 (oversold), similar pattern to BTC with sharp decline. Price at $4,093 after dropping from $4,206. Waiting for clearer reversal signal.\n- **SOL**: RSI at 62.230, showing recovery. Price at $201.24, above EMA20 at $198.05. Interesting but already have capital deployed in XRP.\n- **BNB**: RSI at 39.738, weak momentum. Price at $1,137.50 near EMA20 at $1,134.02. No clear edge.\n- **DOGE**: RSI at 23.695 (deeply oversold), price below EMA20. High risk, avoiding.\n\n**Risk Management:** Currently using $4,497 notional ($300 risk) on XRP position.

I need to carefully evaluate whether current market conditions present good entry opportunities.\n\n### Market Overview - All Coins Showing Weakness:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $112,502 vs EMA20: $113,580 (trading BELOW EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 16.0 - EXTREMELY oversold (below 20)\n- RSI(14): 29.6 - oversold territory\n- MACD: 301.75 declining rapidly (was 920 \u2192 301)\n- Price dropped from $114,992 to $112,502 (-2.2%) in last 30 minutes\n- Strong downtrend with accelerating momentum\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,996.90 vs EMA20: $4,064.38 (trading BELOW EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 23.9 - oversold but not extreme\n- RSI(14): 32.5 - oversold\n- MACD: 11.48 declining (was 59 \u2192 11)\n- Dropped from $4,173 to $3,996 (-4.2%)\n- Weaker than BTC relatively\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $193.95 vs EMA20: $197.58 (trading BELOW EMA)\n- RSI(7): 16.8 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 30.2 - oversold\n- MACD: 0.26 near zero (was 1.98 \u2192 0.26)\n- Down from $202.32 to $193.95 (-4.1%)\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,103.70 vs EMA20: $1,128.46 (trading BELOW EMA)\n- RSI(7): 16.0 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 27.5 - oversold\n- MACD: -1.48 (turned negative)\n- Down from $1,143 to $1,103 (-3.4%)\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.61 vs EMA20: $2.63 (slightly below)\n- RSI(7): 29.1 - oversold\n- RSI(14): 38.1 - approaching oversold\n- MACD: 0.004 near zero\n- Relatively stable, least weak\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.1929 vs EMA20: $0.1988 (trading BELOW EMA)\n- RSI(7): 6.5 - CATASTROPHICALLY oversold (lowest of all)\n- RSI(14): 19.2 - extremely oversold\n- MACD: -0.001 (negative)\n- Down from $0.2038 to $0.1929 (-5.3%)\n- Worst performer\n\n## Trading Decision:\n\n**Market Context:** All coins are in sharp downtrends with extremely oversold RSI readings. This presents a potential mean-reversion opportunity, BUT:\n\n**Risk Considerations:**\n1. All coins below their EMA20 - trend is DOWN\n2. MACD declining on all - momentum is negative\n3. Volume below average on most - weak participation\n4. No clear reversal signals yet\n5. Could be start of larger correction\n\n**Opportunity Assessment:**\n- BTC RSI(7) at 16.0 is extreme - historically bounces from these levels\n- DOGE RSI(7) at 6.5 is catastrophic - high probability of bounce\n- SOL RSI(7) at 16.8 also extreme\n\n**Strategy:** I will take a SMALL contrarian position in BTC as it's the market leader and RSI(7) at 16 is extremely oversold. This is a mean-reversion play with tight risk management. I'll use lower leverage (12x) given the uncertainty and set tight stops.\n\nI will NOT enter DOGE despite extreme oversold because:\n- It's the weakest coin (-5.3% drop)\n- Could continue cascading lower\n- Less liquid/more volatile\n\n**BTC Trade Setup:**\n- Entry: $112,502\n- Profit Target: $115,000 (2.2% move, reasonable bounce target to EMA20 area)\n- Stop Loss: $111,000 (1.3% below entry, -$180 risk with position size)\n- Invalidation: If price breaks below $111,000 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 25 within next 15 minutes\n- Position size: ~$1,200 notional ($100 actual with 12x leverage)\n- Risk: ~$180 (2% of account)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.011,\n      \"profit_target\": 115000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 111000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $111,000 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 25 within 15 minutes indicating continued downtrend\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 180.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price below $111,000? NO - currently at $113,569 \u2713\n2. RSI(7) failed to recover above 25? NO - RSI(7) is at 50.544, well recovered \u2713\n3. The invalidation condition specified \"within 15 minutes\" - it's been 32 minutes total trading time, and RSI recovered from 16.020 to 50.544\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe BTC position is performing well with +$11 profit. The invalidation condition has NOT been met:\n- Price is $2,569 above stop-loss\n- RSI(7) recovered from extreme oversold (16.020) to neutral (50.544)\n- Price bounced from entry and is consolidating above EMA20\n- MACD still positive despite declining momentum\n\nHowever, I notice the profit is small (+0.95%) and momentum is weakening (MACD declining from 1043 to 341). The position is at 12x leverage which is high risk. Given:\n- Weak momentum (MACD declining sharply)\n- Small profit buffer\n- High leverage exposure\n- RSI neutral but not showing strong bullish conviction\n- Price struggling to break higher after bounce\n\n**Risk Management Consideration:**\nWith account down -7.38% and Sharpe ratio of -3.717, I need to be defensive. The position is slightly profitable but showing weakening momentum. The prudent decision is to HOLD for now since invalidation is not met, but monitor closely.\n\n## Other Coins Analysis\n\n**ETH:** No position. Price $4,022.80 below EMA20 ($4,057.38), RSI(7) 39.414 showing weakness, MACD declining. Not attractive for entry.\n\n**SOL:** No position. Price $195.67 below EMA20 ($197.29), RSI(7) 40.842, weak momentum. Not entering.\n\n**BNB:** No position. Price $1,116.60 below EMA20 ($1,127.40), MACD negative (-2.257), RSI(7) 44.246. Bearish, avoiding.\n\n**XRP:** No position. Price $2.63 at EMA20, RSI(7) 57.614 showing some strength, but low conviction. Not entering.\n\n**DOGE:** No position. Price $0.194270 well below EMA20 ($0.198173), RSI(7) 28.413 oversold, MACD negative. Weak, avoiding.\n\n**Final Decision:** HOLD BTC position as invalidation condition is not met. Monitor closely for any breakdown below $111,000 or momentum deterioration.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.011,\n      \"profit_target\": 115000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 111000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $111,000 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 25 within 15 minutes indicating continued downtrend\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 180.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

RSI(7) successfully bounced from 15.87 to 41.26, meeting the recovery requirement. Price is holding above the critical $111,000 level. However, momentum is weakening (declining MACD, price below EMA20). The position is still valid but needs close monitoring. Given we're only up 0.56% with 12x leverage, there's room to let this develop toward the $115,000 target.\n\n**Decision**: HOLD - Invalidation conditions not met, position remains valid\n\n## Other Coins Analysis\n\n### ETH\n- Price: $4,008.70 | RSI(7): 34.29 | MACD: 2.58\n- Weak momentum, below EMA20 ($4,055.47)\n- RSI showing weakness after failed recovery\n- **No position, not entering** - bearish structure\n\n### SOL  \n- Price: $198.84 | RSI(7): 65.37 | MACD: 0.195\n- Strong recovery, above EMA20 ($197.55)\n- RSI bounced from 16.74 to 65.37 - impressive\n- **Potential opportunity but portfolio already exposed** - passing\n\n### BNB\n- Price: $1,113 | RSI(7): 39.30 | MACD: -3.67\n- Below EMA20, negative MACD\n- Weak momentum\n- **No position, not entering**\n\n### XRP\n- Price: $2.65 | RSI(7): 67.09 | MACD: 0.001\n- Strong recovery, above EMA20\n- Good momentum but small MACD\n- **No position, not entering** - prefer to monitor BTC\n\n### DOGE\n- Price: $0.19534 | RSI(7): 42.39 | MACD: -0.001\n- Below EMA20, negative MACD\n- Weak recovery from oversold\n- **No position, not entering**\n\n## Risk Management Summary\n- Current account value: $9,256.32 (-7.44% total return)\n- Available cash: $9,146.29\n- Single BTC position: $1,244.47 notional (13.4% of account)\n- Position is profitable but modest\n- Sharpe ratio: -3.717 (poor risk-adjusted returns)\n\n**Strategy**: Maintain discipline on the BTC position. The invalidation conditions are clear and not yet triggered.

The position entered when RSI was around 15-20 range hoping for a bounce, but instead we've seen:\n1. Price dropped from $113,134 to $111,510 (further decline)\n2. RSI(7) dropped from 41.045 to 21.452 (no recovery)\n3. MACD deteriorated from -108.998 to -273.783 (accelerating bearish momentum)\n\nThe invalidation condition is clearly met - RSI(7) has failed to recover above 25 and price is approaching stop-loss. This is a failed bounce trade.\n\n**Risk Management Decision:** CLOSE POSITION\n- Invalidation condition met\n- Stop-loss nearly hit (within 0.46%)\n- No signs of reversal - all momentum indicators deteriorating\n- Better to take small loss now than risk stop-loss execution or further deterioration\n\n## Market Scan for New Opportunities\n\n**BTC:** Oversold (RSI 21.452) but no reversal confirmation. Wait for stabilization.\n\n**ETH:** RSI(7) = 19.701, RSI(14) = 26.324 - deeply oversold. MACD = -22.625 (negative). Price $3,949.50 vs EMA20 $4,058.04. Similar bearish structure to BTC. Too risky without reversal confirmation.\n\n**SOL:** RSI(7) = 47.842, RSI(14) = 45.698 - neutral zone. MACD = -0.599 (slightly negative). Price $196.76 vs EMA20 $198.02. Most stable of all coins but no clear directional edge. Volume elevated (1.23M vs 698K avg). Neutral - no trade.\n\n**BNB:** RSI(7) = 24.728, RSI(14) = 29.675 - oversold. MACD = -8.050 (negative). Price $1,098.90 vs EMA20 $1,125.90. Bearish momentum. Pass.\n\n**XRP:** RSI(7) = 45.002, RSI(14) = 46.103 - neutral. MACD = -0.004 (near zero). Price $2.62 vs EMA20 $2.63 - very tight consolidation. Most balanced technicals but no clear edge. Volume slightly elevated. Neutral - no trade.\n\n**DOGE:** RSI(7) = 20.293, RSI(14) = 22.435 - deeply oversold. MACD = -0.002 (negative). Price $0.190980 vs EMA20 $0.198149. Weak structure. Pass.\n\n**Conclusion:** Market-wide selling pressure. All major coins showing bearish momentum or oversold conditions without reversal signals. No new positions warranted.

However, given:\n1. My current -7.63% drawdown\n2. Strong bearish momentum (negative MACD across all coins)\n3. All prices trading below EMA20\n4. This appears to be an active selloff (not a bounce yet)\n\n**Strategy:** Wait for signs of stabilization before entering. The RSI levels are extreme (BTC at 16.1, ETH at 13.6) which typically precedes bounces, BUT the MACD is still deeply negative and prices are breaking down. Entering now could catch a falling knife.\n\nThe prudent approach is to wait for:\n- RSI to start turning up from oversold levels\n- MACD to show positive divergence\n- Price to reclaim EMA20 or show clear support\n\nGiven my negative performance and the violent nature of this selloff, I will NOT enter any positions at this moment. Better to preserve capital and wait for confirmation of a reversal.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

I need to carefully evaluate whether current market conditions present good entry opportunities.\n\n### Market Overview:\nAll major coins are showing significant weakness:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $110,102 vs EMA20: $113,027 (trading 2.6% below)\n- RSI(7): 13.15 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 19.76 - Severely oversold\n- MACD: -711.99 - Strong bearish momentum\n- Price dropped from $114,350 to $110,102 in 30 minutes (-3.7%)\n- Below both 20 and 50 period EMAs on 4H timeframe\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,902 vs EMA20: $4,032 (trading 3.2% below)\n- RSI(7): 13.49 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 20.79 - Severely oversold\n- MACD: -42.49 - Strong bearish momentum\n- Dropped from $4,111 to $3,902 in 30 minutes (-5.1%)\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $193.99 vs EMA20: $197.29 (trading 1.7% below)\n- RSI(7): 38.64 - Approaching oversold but not extreme\n- RSI(14): 39.03 - Neutral territory\n- MACD: -1.26 - Mild bearish\n- Relatively stable compared to BTC/ETH\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.55 vs EMA20: $2.62 (trading 2.7% below)\n- RSI(7): 16.84 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 25.53 - Severely oversold\n- MACD: -0.007 - Bearish\n- Sharp decline from $2.64 to $2.55\n\n**BNB & DOGE:**\n- Both showing weakness but less extreme than BTC/ETH/XRP\n\n## Trading Decision Rationale:\n\nThe market is showing extreme oversold conditions across multiple assets, particularly BTC, ETH, and XRP with RSI(7) readings below 17. This typically indicates capitulation selling and potential for a bounce.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n1. **Extreme RSI readings** - RSI(7) at 13-16 on BTC, ETH, XRP suggests panic selling\n2. **Mean reversion opportunity** - Prices significantly below EMA20\n3. **Risk management** - After -7.63% drawdown, need to be selective\n4. **Volume confirmation** - XRP showing elevated volume (17.8M vs 9.7M avg)\n\n**Strategy:**\nI will enter a SMALL position in **BTC** as it's the market leader and showing the most extreme oversold conditions. The risk is that this could be the start of a larger correction, but the RSI(7) at 13.15 is historically a strong reversal signal.\n\nI will use:\n- Conservative leverage (12x)\n- Tight stop-loss below recent lows\n- Risk only ~$400 (4.3% of capital)\n- Quick profit target at EMA20 retest\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.04,\n      \"profit_target\": 113000,\n      \"stop_loss\": 108500,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price breaks below $108,500 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 25 within next 15 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price breaks below $108,500 - \u2705 NOT MET (current $111,430, well above)\n2. RSI(7) fails to recover above 25 within 15 minutes - \u2705 NOT MET (RSI now 47.415, recovered)\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe position is showing positive momentum:\n- RSI recovered from extreme oversold (12.905) to neutral (47.415)\n- Price bounced off the low and holding above entry\n- Stop-loss at $108,500 provides $2,930 cushion (2.6%)\n- Profit target at $113,000 is $1,570 away (1.4%)\n- MACD showing slight improvement\n\nHowever, considering risk management:\n- We're down -7.10% overall on the account\n- Price is still below EMA20 ($112,864), indicating downtrend not fully reversed\n- MACD still deeply negative\n- The bounce could be a dead cat bounce in a larger downtrend\n\n**DECISION: HOLD** - The invalidation condition is NOT met. RSI has recovered above 25, price is above stop-loss, and we're seeing positive momentum. The position has room to reach profit target at $113,000. Will continue monitoring closely.\n\n## Other Coins Analysis\n\n**ETH:** No position. RSI(7) 39.971, deeply below EMA20, MACD negative. Not entering.\n\n**SOL:** No position. RSI(7) 49.769 neutral, below EMA20, MACD negative. Choppy action. Not entering.\n\n**BNB:** No position. RSI(7) 61.663 showing strength, but below EMA20. Not entering.\n\n**XRP:** No position. RSI(7) 42.283, below EMA20, MACD negative. Not entering.\n\n**DOGE:** No position. RSI(7) 40.209, below EMA20, weak. Not entering.\n\nMarket conditions remain challenging across all assets.

Price hasn't broken below $108,500 (currently $1,284 above)\n2. RSI(7) HAS recovered above 25 (now at 26.909)\n\nHowever, concerning factors:\n- MACD deteriorating significantly (-1247 vs -1140)\n- Price trending down, not up\n- Still well below EMA20\n- Only $1,284 cushion to stop-loss (1.17%)\n- Minimal profit potential from here vs downside risk\n\n**Decision:** CLOSE POSITION\nReasoning: While the strict invalidation condition hasn't been violated, the technical picture is deteriorating. RSI barely recovered above 25 (26.909), MACD is worsening, and price momentum is negative. The risk/reward is unfavorable with only $1,284 to stop-loss vs $3,216 to profit target. Better to preserve capital and wait for clearer setup.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE: All showing oversold conditions with negative MACD and prices below EMAs.

However, the momentum is still strongly negative.\n\n**Strategy**: Enter small positions on the most oversold assets (ETH and DOGE) with tight stop-losses, targeting a bounce back toward EMA20 levels. These are counter-trend trades requiring strict risk management.\n\n**ETH Trade Rationale**:\n- RSI(7) at 10.29 is extreme - historically bounces from these levels\n- Target: Bounce to 3,850 (partial retracement toward EMA20)\n- Stop: Below 3,720 (if selling accelerates further)\n- Risk: ~$400 (4.3% of capital)\n\n**DOGE Trade Rationale**:\n- RSI(7) at 10.70 with 3.45x volume suggests climax selling\n- Target: 0.188 (retracement toward recent support)\n- Stop: Below 0.177 (new lows would invalidate bounce thesis)\n- Risk: ~$400 (4.3% of capital)\n\nTotal risk exposure: ~$800 (8.6% of capital) across two uncorrelated bounce plays.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 3850.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3720.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3720 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued breakdown rather than oversold bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 33000,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.188,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.177,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.177 on 3-minute candle, confirming breakdown to new lows rather than capitulation bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.58,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

RSI readings below 10-15 are extremely rare and typically indicate panic selling. However, given:\n\n1. **Severe downtrend momentum**: All MACD indicators showing accelerating bearish momentum\n2. **No signs of reversal**: No bullish divergence, no volume exhaustion patterns\n3. **All EMAs trending down**: No support levels holding\n4. **Poor account performance**: Already down 11.39% with negative Sharpe ratio\n5. **Catching falling knives risk**: Extremely dangerous to enter during capitulation without confirmation\n\n### Strategy Decision\n**DO NOT ENTER ANY POSITIONS**\n\nWhile these oversold conditions will eventually reverse, attempting to catch the exact bottom during a capitulation event is extremely risky. The proper approach is to:\n- Wait for RSI to show bullish divergence\n- Wait for price to reclaim EMA20 or show stabilization\n- Wait for MACD to show momentum shift\n- Preserve capital during extreme volatility\n\nWith account already down 11.39%, risk management dictates waiting for confirmation rather than gambling on a bottom. The market can remain oversold longer than expected, and prices can fall much further during panic selling.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

This suggests a strong bearish move is underway, but we're seeing some RSI recovery from extreme oversold levels.\n\n### Individual Coin Analysis:\n\n**BTC (108,360)**:\n- Price well below EMA20 (111,252) - bearish\n- MACD deeply negative (-1,681) and worsening\n- RSI(7) at 41.2, recovering from 11.8 extreme oversold\n- RSI(14) at 35.1, also recovering from 16.4\n- Price bounced from 106,526 to 108,360 (+1.7%)\n- **Assessment**: Potential dead cat bounce in strong downtrend. Too risky to enter long here. Need confirmation of trend reversal.\n\n**ETH (3,803.70)**:\n- Price below EMA20 (3,949) - bearish\n- MACD negative (-96.6)\n- RSI(7) at 43.4, strong recovery from 6.6 extreme oversold\n- RSI(14) at 35.8, recovering from 10.5\n- Price bounced from 3,688 to 3,803 (+3.1%)\n- **Assessment**: Stronger bounce than BTC, but still in downtrend. RSI recovery is notable but need more confirmation.\n\n**SOL (184.62)**:\n- Price below EMA20 (193.10) - bearish\n- MACD negative (-3.576)\n- RSI(7) at 37.9, recovering from 10.5\n- Price bounced from 179.02 to 184.62 (+3.1%)\n- **Assessment**: Similar pattern to ETH. Oversold bounce but trend remains down.\n\n**BNB (1,078.20)**:\n- Price below EMA20 (1,108.39) - bearish\n- MACD negative (-14.830)\n- RSI(7) at 37.1, recovering from 11.2\n- Price bounced from 1,061 to 1,078 (+1.6%)\n- **Assessment**: Weakest bounce. Still very bearish.\n\n**XRP (2.44)**:\n- Price below EMA20 (2.56) - bearish\n- MACD deeply negative (-0.052)\n- RSI(7) at 32.8, recovering from 7.7 extreme oversold\n- Price bounced from 2.38 to 2.44 (+2.5%)\n- **Assessment**: Oversold bounce but weak overall structure.\n\n**DOGE (0.182530)**:\n- Price below EMA20 (0.191604) - bearish\n- MACD negative (-0.005)\n- RSI(7) at 39.3, recovering from 8.0 extreme oversold\n- Price bounced from 0.176840 to 0.182530 (+3.2%)\n- **Assessment**: Good bounce percentage but still in downtrend.\n\n## Trading Decision:\n\n**Risk Management Consideration**: With account down 11.39% and Sharpe ratio at -5.342, I need to be extremely cautious. All coins are showing oversold bounces, but these could be dead cat bounces in a continuing downtrend.\n\n**Best Opportunity**: ETH and DOGE show the strongest RSI recoveries from extreme oversold levels (6.6 and 8.0 respectively). However, all coins remain below their EMA20s with negative MACD.\n\n**Decision**: **WAIT**. While there are oversold bounces occurring, there's no clear trend reversal signal. All coins remain in confirmed downtrends (price < EMA20, negative MACD). Entering now would be catching a falling knife. Better to preserve capital and wait for:\n1. Price to reclaim EMA20\n2. MACD to show bullish crossover\n3. RSI to confirm momentum shift above 50\n\nGiven the poor portfolio performance, capital preservation is paramount. No trades.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",
