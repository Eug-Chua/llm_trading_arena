I need to analyze the market conditions across all coins to identify the best entry opportunities.\n\n## Market Overview Analysis\n\n**BTC (109160):**\n- Price well below EMA20 (111104.55), indicating downtrend\n- MACD deeply negative (-1429.362) and still declining\n- RSI(7) at 43.856 - recovering from oversold but not yet bullish\n- Recent price action shows volatility: dropped from 111405 to 108211, now recovering to 109160\n- Below both 20 and 50 period EMAs on 4H timeframe\n- Volume significantly below average (3548 vs 7856)\n- Assessment: In downtrend but showing signs of bottoming. Too early to enter.\n\n**ETH (3930.90):**\n- Price below EMA20 (4023.44), downtrend confirmed\n- MACD negative (-71.784) but showing slight improvement\n- RSI(7) at 45.554 - neutral territory, recovering from oversold\n- Similar pattern to BTC: sharp drop from 4061 to 3864, now recovering\n- Below both EMAs on 4H timeframe\n- Low volume (52185 vs 135853)\n- Assessment: Weak but stabilizing. Not compelling yet.\n\n**SOL (186.91):**\n- Price significantly below EMA20 (195.30), strong downtrend\n- MACD negative (-5.057) and worsening\n- RSI(7) at 35.557 - weak, recovering from deeply oversold (19.011)\n- Dropped from 196.80 to 184.76, slight recovery\n- Volume very low (464414 vs 1197511)\n- Assessment: Weak momentum, not ready for entry.\n\n**BNB (1149.30):**\n- Price well below EMA20 (1188.16), downtrend\n- MACD negative (-31.536) but stabilizing\n- RSI(7) at 37.756 - weak but improving from 13.516\n- Sharp drop from 1183.80 to 1134.80, now recovering\n- Very low volume (4336 vs 19293)\n- Assessment: Oversold bounce potential but still weak.\n\n**XRP (2.36):**\n- Price below EMA20 (2.44), downtrend\n- MACD negative (-0.058) and stable\n- RSI(7) at 41.475 - neutral, recovering from 20.307\n- Dropped from 2.45 to 2.33, now at 2.36\n- Volume above average (13076200 vs 10321690) - NOTABLE\n- Assessment: Showing relative strength with higher volume. Most interesting setup.\n\n**DOGE (0.190230):**\n- Price below EMA20 (0.198261), downtrend\n- MACD negative (-0.005) and stable\n- RSI(7) at 37.342 - weak but recovering from 18.498\n- Dropped from 0.200260 to 0.187720, now at 0.190230\n- Very low volume (16194734 vs 67545594)\n- Assessment: Weak with poor volume.\n\n## Trading Decision\n\nAll coins are in downtrends with prices below their EMAs and negative MACD readings. However, this appears to be a market-wide correction that may be bottoming based on:\n1. RSI values recovering from deeply oversold levels\n2. Recent price stabilization after sharp drops\n3. MACD values showing signs of stabilization\n\n**XRP stands out** as the most compelling opportunity because:\n- Volume is ABOVE average (only coin showing this)\n- RSI recovery is strong (from 20.307 to 41.475)\n- Price action shows resilience\n- Smaller percentage drop compared to others\n\nI will enter a LONG position on XRP with tight risk management, anticipating a bounce from oversold conditions. I'll use 15x leverage to maximize capital efficiency while keeping position size conservative.\n\nEntry: 2.36\nStop-loss: 2.28 (3.4% below entry, below recent low of 2.33)\nProfit target: 2.52 (6.8% above entry, near EMA20 resistance at 2.44)\nRisk: ~$500 (5% of capital)\nInvalidation: If price closes below 2.30 on 3-minute candle (confirms breakdown)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 3180,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.52,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.28,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.30 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown continuation\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 508.80\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

This is my second invocation at the start of trading.\n\n### Market Overview - ALL COINS SHOWING SEVERE OVERSOLD CONDITIONS\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $105,589 vs EMA20: $110,350 (-4.3% below)\n- RSI(7): 17.8 - EXTREMELY oversold (below 20)\n- RSI(14): 22.3 - Deeply oversold\n- MACD: -1,386 and deteriorating rapidly\n- Price dropped from $111,268 to $105,589 (-5.1%) in 30 minutes\n- Below both 20 and 50 EMA on 4H timeframe\n- Volume elevated (9,740 vs avg 8,197)\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,756 vs EMA20: $3,986 (-5.8% below)\n- RSI(7): 20.6 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 25.5 - Deeply oversold\n- MACD: -68.5 and worsening\n- Dropped from $4,061 to $3,756 (-7.5%) in 30 minutes\n- Volume spike: 213,882 vs avg 142,519 (+50%)\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $177.65 vs EMA20: $193.22 (-8.1% below)\n- RSI(7): 16.4 - MOST OVERSOLD of all coins\n- RSI(14): 21.5 - Severely oversold\n- Dropped from $196.80 to $177.65 (-9.7%) in 30 minutes\n- This is a CAPITULATION move\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,062.60 vs EMA20: $1,174.19 (-9.5% below)\n- RSI(7): 9.5 - CATASTROPHICALLY oversold (lowest reading)\n- RSI(14): 14.7 - Extreme oversold\n- Massive drop from $1,183.80 to $1,062.60 (-10.2%)\n- This is panic selling territory\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.24 vs EMA20: $2.41 (-7.1% below)\n- RSI(7): 17.4 - Extremely oversold\n- RSI(14): 21.1 - Deeply oversold\n- Dropped from $2.45 to $2.24 (-8.6%)\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.17849 vs EMA20: $0.19555 (-8.7% below)\n- RSI(7): 14.8 - Extremely oversold\n- RSI(14): 19.2 - Severely oversold\n- Dropped from $0.20026 to $0.17849 (-10.9%)\n\n## Trading Strategy\n\nThis is a FLASH CRASH scenario across all crypto assets. Every single coin shows:\n1. RSI(7) below 25 (most below 20)\n2. Price 5-10% below EMA20\n3. Negative MACD divergence\n4. Elevated volume on the selloff\n\n**OPPORTUNITY:** Mean reversion plays on the most oversold assets with tight risk management.\n\n**Best Candidates:**\n1. **BNB** - RSI(7) at 9.5 is absurdly oversold, -9.5% from EMA20\n2. **SOL** - RSI(7) at 16.4, -8.1% from EMA20, strong altcoin\n3. **DOGE** - RSI(7) at 14.8, -8.7% from EMA20\n\n**Risk Management:**\n- Use 15x leverage for mean reversion (higher than trend following)\n- Tight stop-losses (2-3% below entry)\n- Quick profit targets (3-5% bounce expected)\n- Risk $800-1,000 per position\n- Total exposure: ~$2,500 across 3 positions\n\n**Entry Logic:**\nThese RSI levels (9.5, 14.8, 16.4) represent extreme fear and typically bounce within 15-30 minutes. I'm buying the panic with defined risk.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.8,\n      \"profit_target\": 1105.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1035.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If RSI(7) drops below 8 or price closes below $1,035 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.82,\n      \"risk_usd\": 850.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 185.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 172.50,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If RSI(7) drops below 12 or price closes below $172.50 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 888.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 28000,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.186,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.173,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If RSI(7) drops below 10 or price closes below $0.173 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 750.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, the position is showing concerning signs:\n1. Price failed to hold above $1,118 and pulled back\n2. Still trading below EMA20 ($1,123.36)\n3. Volume is weak (60% of average)\n4. MACD still negative despite improvement\n5. Already down over $1,000 on this trade\n\nDespite the invalidation not being triggered, the technical setup is deteriorating. The bounce from $1,062 to $1,118 was rejected, and we're now consolidating lower. With RSI(7) at 54, there's limited momentum. The risk/reward is poor here - we're $42.80 from stop-loss but $77.20 from profit target.\n\n**DECISION: CLOSE POSITION** - While the strict invalidation hasn't triggered, the technical deterioration, weak volume, failure to reclaim EMA20, and poor risk/reward justify exiting. Taking a controlled loss here is better risk management than waiting for the stop-loss to be hit.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE: All showing recovery but still below their EMA20s with negative MACD. Not compelling setups.\n- XRP: Strongest performer with RSI(7) at 75.4 and price above EMA20, but already extended and overbought - not a good entry point.\n- No new positions warranted given current market weakness and existing loss.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 67.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1180.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1060.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,060 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 40\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 582.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - price failed to reclaim EMA20 after bounce, weak volume (60% of average), poor risk/reward with $42.80 to stop vs $77.20 to target, and position already down $1,055.

The price is exactly at EMA20, not definitively below it. However, the momentum has clearly weakened:\n- RSI dropped from 79.48 to 45.27 in one candle\n- Price dropped from $2.37 to $2.35\n- This suggests the breakout attempt may be failing\n\n**Risk Management Consideration:**\n- Position is down $51 (small loss)\n- Stop-loss at $2.33 is only $0.02 away\n- With 15x leverage, a move to $2.33 would trigger stop-loss\n- Current price action shows indecision at EMA20 support\n\n**Decision:** CLOSE POSITION\nWhile the invalidation condition technically requires a close \"below\" EMA20, the price is exactly at EMA20 with weakening momentum. The sharp RSI drop from 79 to 45 in one candle indicates the bullish momentum has evaporated. Given we're at the invalidation level with deteriorating technicals, it's prudent to exit now rather than risk the stop-loss being hit for a slightly larger loss.\n\n**Other Coins - No New Positions:**\n- **BTC**: Below EMA20 ($106,726 vs $107,771), RSI 36 oversold, MACD negative and declining. Downtrend intact.\n- **ETH**: Near EMA20 ($3,886 vs $3,897), RSI 51 neutral, MACD improving but still negative. Consolidating.\n- **SOL**: Below EMA20 ($185.81 vs $186.66), RSI 47 neutral, MACD negative. No clear setup.\n- **BNB**: Well below EMA20 ($1,084 vs $1,111), RSI 35 oversold, MACD very negative. Weak.\n- **DOGE**: Below EMA20 ($0.1887 vs $0.1892), RSI 50 neutral, MACD negative. No edge.\n\nNo compelling setups for new entries.

RSI at 82.6 is unsustainably high, and we're close to profit target. Better to lock in gains than risk reversal from extreme overbought conditions.\n\n### SOL Position Analysis\n- **Entry**: $188.86 | **Current**: $187.77 | **P&L**: -$188.32 (-0.58%)\n- **Invalidation Condition**: \"If price closes below $185.00 on 3-minute candle\"\n- **Stop Loss**: $184.50 | **Profit Target**: $195.00\n- **Current Status**: Price at $187.77 is ABOVE invalidation level ($185.00)\n- **Technical Analysis**:\n  - RSI (7): 48.677 - Neutral, cooling off from overbought\n  - RSI (14): 54.775 - Neutral\n  - MACD: 1.115 - Slightly positive but weakening (was 1.135)\n  - Price above EMA20 ($186.31) - still bullish\n  - Recent price action: $190.67 \u2192 $188.81 \u2192 $187.77 (downtrend forming)\n  - Price dropped from $190.67 high, now below entry\n- **Risk Assessment**:\n  - Currently down $188, but invalidation NOT triggered\n  - Price trending down but still above critical $185 level\n  - MACD momentum weakening\n  - Stop loss at $184.50 is only $3.27 away (1.74%)\n- **Decision**: **HOLD** - Invalidation condition NOT met.

The invalidation condition has NOT been triggered.\n\n**Distance to Targets:**\n- Profit target $195.00 is $3.86 away (2.0% move needed)\n- Stop-loss $184.50 is $6.64 away (3.5% move needed)\n- Risk/Reward ratio remains favorable\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe SOL position is performing well with positive momentum. The invalidation condition has not been met (no close below $185.00). Technical indicators show continued bullish momentum with MACD rising, price above EMA20, and strong volume. RSI at 70.36 is elevated but not at extreme levels that would signal immediate reversal. The position is approaching profit target ($3.86 away) with strong upward momentum.\n\nGiven the strong technical setup and the fact that no exit conditions have been triggered, I will HOLD this position and let it run toward the $195 profit target.\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- BTC: RSI 86.83 (extremely overbought), massive rally to $110,100. Too extended for new entry.\n- ETH: RSI 90.33 (extremely overbought), parabolic move. Too risky for new entry.\n- BNB: RSI 73.78, recovering but MACD still negative. Not compelling.\n- XRP: RSI 80.88 (overbought), strong move but late to enter.\n- DOGE: RSI 81.81 (overbought), extended move. Too risky.\n\nAll other coins show overbought conditions with no existing positions.

Better risk/reward than chasing BTC at extreme levels\n\nI'll enter a conservative ETH long position with:\n- Tight stop-loss below recent consolidation support\n- Profit target at previous resistance zone\n- 15x leverage for moderate position sizing\n- Risk ~$500 (5% of capital)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.2,\n      \"profit_target\": 4100.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3960.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,960 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown of consolidation support\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.70,\n      \"risk_usd\": 516.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price is still $20.40 above the $3,960 stop-loss level. However, we're very close to the stop-loss, and the recent price action shows weakness (down from $4,053.40 to $3,980.40 in the last few candles). RSI dropped from 93.781 to 40.564, indicating strong selling pressure.\n\n**Risk Assessment:** \n- We're dangerously close to stop-loss ($20.40 buffer)\n- RSI showing oversold on 7-period (40.564) but momentum clearly bearish\n- MACD declining but still positive\n- Price still above EMA20, which is supportive\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - The invalidation condition explicitly states \"closes below $3,960\" and we're currently at $3,980.40. The technical structure (price above EMA20, positive MACD) suggests the uptrend may still be intact despite the pullback. The oversold RSI (7-period at 40.564) could indicate a bounce is imminent. I will maintain the position but monitor closely for the next candle.\n\n## Market Opportunities Analysis\n\n**BTC:** \n- Strong uptrend: $110,753 (above EMA20 at $108,753)\n- RSI (7): 70.251 - overbought but not extreme\n- MACD: 1,055.250 - very strong momentum\n- Volume: 8,550 vs avg 4,155 - high volume confirming move\n- **Assessment:** Strong momentum but already extended. Would need pullback to enter safely.\n\n**SOL:**\n- Price: $188.77 vs EMA20: $187.94 - slightly above\n- RSI (7): 37.959 - oversold\n- MACD: 1.934 - positive but declining\n- **Assessment:** Showing weakness, not compelling for entry.\n\n**BNB:**\n- Price: $1,100.90 vs EMA20: $1,101.76 - at EMA\n- RSI (7): 32.170 - oversold\n- MACD: 9.034 - declining\n- **Assessment:** Weak momentum, consolidating.\n\n**XRP:**\n- Price: $2.52 vs EMA20: $2.40 - strong breakout\n- RSI (7): 89.376 - extremely overbought\n- MACD: 0.044 - accelerating\n- Volume: 7,531,865 vs avg 4,731,611 - high volume\n- **Assessment:** Parabolic move, too risky to chase at these levels.\n\n**DOGE:**\n- Price: $0.19953 vs EMA20: $0.19370 - above EMA\n- RSI (7): 66.693 - neutral to slightly overbought\n- MACD: 0.004 - positive momentum\n- **Assessment:** Decent setup but not compelling enough given current portfolio stress.\n\n## Portfolio Risk Management\n\n- Current account value: $9,606.90 (down 3.93%)\n- Available cash: $9,318.11\n- Single position (ETH) at risk\n- Sharpe ratio: -2.040 (poor risk-adjusted returns)\n\nGiven we're down 3.93% and have a negative Sharpe ratio, I need to be cautious about adding new positions. The ETH position is near stop-loss, so I'll maintain discipline and let the trade play out according to the plan.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.2,\n      \"profit_target\": 4100.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3960.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,960 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown of consolidation support\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 516.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

I need to carefully evaluate entry opportunities while being mindful of the negative performance so far.\n\n### Market Overview:\nAll major coins are showing sharp pullbacks from recent highs:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $109,008 (down from $111,161 high)\n- RSI(7): 26.89 - OVERSOLD territory (was 91.93 at peak)\n- RSI(14): 45.50 - neutral but declining\n- Price below EMA20 ($108,873) - first time in this sequence\n- MACD declining from 1,136 to 1,001 but still positive\n- Sharp reversal from extreme overbought conditions\n- This is a healthy pullback after parabolic move\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,922.60 (down from $4,053.40 high)\n- RSI(7): 20.02 - SEVERELY OVERSOLD (was 93.75 at peak)\n- RSI(14): 37.84 - oversold\n- Price dropped below EMA20 ($3,944.83)\n- MACD declining but still positive (35.28)\n- Extreme oversold conditions suggest bounce potential\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $185.46 (down from $192.93 high)\n- RSI(7): 24.15 - OVERSOLD (was 77.68 at peak)\n- RSI(14): 37.23 - oversold\n- Price below EMA20 ($187.74)\n- Sharp pullback creating potential entry\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,081.30 (down from $1,127.90 high)\n- RSI(7): 16.02 - EXTREMELY OVERSOLD (was 76.10 at peak)\n- RSI(14): 32.76 - oversold\n- Price significantly below EMA20 ($1,099.32)\n- Most oversold of all major coins\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.45 (down from $2.52 high)\n- RSI(7): 45.06 - neutral (was 89.42 at peak)\n- RSI(14): 55.89 - neutral\n- Price ABOVE EMA20 ($2.41) - showing relative strength\n- MACD still positive and above EMA\n- Holding up better than others\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.19652 (down from $0.20115 high)\n- RSI(7): 33.77 - oversold (was 86.74 at peak)\n- RSI(14): 51.90 - neutral\n- Price ABOVE EMA20 ($0.19451) - showing strength\n- Pullback less severe than others\n\n## Trading Strategy:\n\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions across the board, this presents potential mean-reversion opportunities. However, I must be cautious:\n\n1. **BNB** - Most oversold (RSI 16.02), but also furthest below EMA20. High risk.\n2. **ETH** - Severely oversold (RSI 20.02), good bounce candidate\n3. **BTC** - Oversold (RSI 26.89), market leader\n4. **XRP** - Showing relative strength, still above EMA20, moderate RSI\n\n**Decision:** I'll enter **XRP** as it's showing the best relative strength (still above EMA20, moderate RSI, positive MACD) while others are in freefall. This is a momentum continuation play rather than trying to catch a falling knife.\n\nAlternative consideration: **ETH** for mean reversion, but the severity of the drop (RSI 20) suggests more downside risk.\n\n**Risk Management:**\n- Position size: ~$500 risk (5.2% of account)\n- Leverage: 15x for better capital efficiency\n- Tight stop-loss below recent support\n- Profit target at next resistance level\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 3060,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.58,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.38,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.38 (below recent support and EMA20) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

This suggests a failed breakout attempt with potential for mean reversion bounces.\n\n**Risk Management:** Given the -6.12% drawdown and poor Sharpe ratio, I need to be selective. The market is showing oversold conditions across the board, which could present bounce opportunities, but the failed breakout pattern is concerning.\n\n**Best Opportunity:** ETH shows the most oversold conditions (RSI 33.44) with negative MACD at -22.863, suggesting potential for a technical bounce back toward the EMA20 at $3,921. The risk/reward is favorable for a mean reversion trade.\n\n**Trade Setup for ETH:**\n- Entry: $3,839.20\n- Profit Target: $3,920 (near EMA20, ~2.1% move)\n- Stop Loss: $3,800 (~1% below entry, below recent lows)\n- Risk: $500 (conservative given drawdown)\n- Leverage: 12x (moderate)\n- Invalidation: If price breaks below $3,800 or RSI fails to recover above 40\n\nI will pass on other coins due to:\n- BTC: Too much volatility, unclear direction\n- SOL: Similar setup to ETH but weaker volume profile\n- BNB: Not oversold enough for mean reversion\n- XRP/DOGE: Lower conviction, smaller market cap volatility\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.25,\n      \"profit_target\": 3920.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3800.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,800 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) fails to recover above 40 within next 3 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price at $3,802.30 is currently ABOVE $3,800 stop-loss by only $2.30\n2. Current RSI(7) = 25.394 (extremely oversold, below 40)\n3. Looking at RSI(7) history: [28.020, 33.310, 25.394] - declining, NOT recovering\n4. We are now 3+ candles past entry and RSI has NOT recovered above 40\n5. Price is dangerously close to stop-loss level\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n- RSI(7): 25.394 - severely oversold, showing continued weakness\n- RSI(14): 31.634 - also oversold\n- MACD: -39.073 - strongly negative and worsening (was -33.287 last candle)\n- Price below EMA20 ($3,917.07) by $114.77\n- Downtrend intact with lower lows: [3839.20 \u2192 3802.30]\n- Volume: 87,553 vs average 104,639 (below average, weak buying pressure)\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe invalidation condition has been MET on the RSI recovery criterion. RSI(7) has failed to recover above 40 within the next 3 candles - it's actually gotten worse (25.394). Additionally, price is only $2.30 away from the stop-loss at $3,800, representing imminent risk. The technical picture shows:\n- Accelerating bearish momentum (MACD worsening)\n- No RSI recovery (invalidation met)\n- Price approaching stop-loss\n- Weak volume suggesting no buying support\n\n**Risk Management:** With 12x leverage, a move below $3,800 would trigger the stop-loss. Given the invalidation condition is met and we're at high risk of stop-loss trigger, the prudent decision is to CLOSE this position to preserve capital and avoid a forced liquidation scenario.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC, SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE: All showing oversold conditions (RSI 7-period: 38.4, 17.5, 41.5, 22.8, 28.4) with negative MACD and prices below EMA20. Market-wide weakness suggests this is not a good entry point.

RSI has recovered nicely from oversold levels (17.080 \u2192 45.785), suggesting the bounce has legs. Price is holding above the critical $180 support level where we entered.\n\nHowever, I note:\n- Price is still below EMA20 ($185.90), indicating we're in a corrective phase\n- MACD remains negative (though stabilizing)\n- We're about $3.71 away from profit target ($186.50)\n- The recent bounce from $180 to $182.79 shows buying interest\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - The invalidation condition is not met, RSI has recovered as required, and we're in profit with a reasonable path to the $186.50 target. The stop-loss at $177 provides adequate protection.\n\n### Other Coins Assessment:\n- **BTC**: Below EMA20, RSI neutral at 51.9, MACD negative - consolidating after sharp drop\n- **ETH**: Weak technicals, RSI 40.6, below EMA20, MACD negative - bearish\n- **BNB**: At EMA20, RSI 64.8 showing strength, MACD improving - potential but not compelling\n- **XRP**: Below EMA20, RSI 35.8 (weak), MACD negative - bearish\n- **DOGE**: Below EMA20, RSI 39.5 (weak), MACD negative - bearish\n\n**No new positions warranted** - Market showing general weakness across most assets.

NO - price at $187.94 > EMA20 at $186.88 \u2713\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Position is slightly profitable (+$18.54)\n- RSI at 71.1 indicates overbought conditions - potential for pullback\n- MACD still negative suggests underlying weakness\n- Price bounced strongly from $180 level but now showing signs of exhaustion\n- Volume below average suggests weak conviction in this move\n- Stop-loss at $180 is $7.94 away (4.2% move)\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe invalidation conditions are NOT met - price remains above both $180 and EMA20. However, the overbought RSI (71.1) combined with negative MACD and below-average volume suggests this rally may be losing steam. The position is barely profitable (+0.24% of account), and we're in overbought territory.\n\nGiven that:\n- Invalidation NOT triggered\n- Price holding above key support\n- Small profit but overbought conditions\n- Risk/reward still intact with stop at $180\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - Continue monitoring closely.

Risk of pullback. Would prefer entry on retracement.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Price: $3,859.40 (below EMA20: $3,890.13)\n- RSI(7) = 50.07 (neutral, was 64.28 three candles ago - losing momentum)\n- MACD: -35.17 (still negative, slight improvement)\n- Price 0.79% below EMA20 - weak relative to BTC\n- Volume elevated (147,977 vs 111,304) but price not responding\n- **Assessment:** Weak price action despite volume. Not attractive for entry.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Price: $191.13 (above EMA20: $187.31)\n- Very strong momentum: RSI(7) = 80.92 (extremely overbought)\n- MACD improving rapidly: -0.43 (was -2.10, near crossover)\n- Price 2.04% above EMA20 - strongest relative strength\n- Volume above average (786,380 vs 772,606)\n- Massive recovery from $180.00 low (+6.2% in 30 minutes)\n- **Assessment:** BEST SETUP. Strong breakout with momentum, but RSI extreme. High risk/reward if we can catch continuation.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Price: $1,117.20 (above EMA20: $1,094.27)\n- RSI(7) = 63.61 (healthy, not overbought)\n- MACD positive: +1.42 (just crossed bullish)\n- Price 2.10% above EMA20\n- Volume significantly elevated (16,784 vs 10,302)\n- Strong recovery from $1,068.70 (+4.5%)\n- **Assessment:** Good setup. MACD bullish crossover with room to run before overbought.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Price: $2.41 (slightly below EMA20: $2.42)\n- RSI(7) = 56.56 (neutral)\n- MACD: -0.018 (slightly negative, flat)\n- Price hugging EMA20, no clear direction\n- Volume elevated but price choppy\n- **Assessment:** No clear trend. Pass.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Price: $0.19577 (above EMA20: $0.19478)\n- RSI(7) = 72.90 (overbought)\n- MACD: -0.001 (near zero, improving)\n- Price 0.51% above EMA20\n- Volume elevated (44.27M vs 28.76M)\n- **Assessment:** Moderate momentum but RSI stretched. Less attractive than BNB or SOL.\n\n## Trading Decision\n\nGiven the market conditions, I see two strong candidates:\n1. **SOL** - Strongest momentum but RSI extremely overbought (80.92)\n2. **BNB** - Strong momentum with MACD bullish crossover and RSI at healthy 63.61\n\n**Decision: Enter BNB**\n- MACD just crossed positive (bullish signal)\n- RSI has room to run (63.61 vs SOL's 80.92)\n- Strong volume confirmation\n- Price above EMA20 with clear uptrend\n- Lower risk of immediate pullback vs SOL\n\nPosition sizing: Risk $500 (5% of capital)\nEntry: $1,117.20\nStop-loss: $1,085 (2.88% below entry, below recent consolidation low of $1,086.40)\nProfit target: $1,165 (4.28% above entry, 1.5:1 reward/risk)\nLeverage: 15x (moderate for this setup)\nInvalidation: If price closes below $1,085 or MACD turns negative\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.134,\n      \"profit_target\": 1165.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1085.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,085 on 3-minute candle or MACD turns negative\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price check: Current $1,103.40 is ABOVE stop-loss $1,085.00 \u2713\n2. MACD check: Current MACD = 11.902 (POSITIVE) \u2713\n3. However, examining the recent price action:\n   - Sharp drop from $1,124.80 to $1,103.40 (-$21.40 in one candle)\n   - RSI(7) plummeted from 59.527 to 34.252 (oversold territory)\n   - RSI(14) dropped from 61.989 to 47.732\n   - Price is now barely above EMA20 ($1,101.46)\n   - MACD declining from 13.459 to 11.902 (losing momentum)\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nThe position is showing weakness with a sharp reversal. While invalidation conditions are technically not met yet, the momentum has clearly shifted bearish. The RSI(7) at 34.252 indicates oversold conditions, but this could be the start of a larger correction. The price is only $18.40 away from the stop-loss, representing significant downside risk.\n\n**Decision:** CLOSE POSITION\nReason: Risk management - sharp bearish reversal with deteriorating technicals. While invalidation not technically triggered, the momentum shift and proximity to stop-loss warrant defensive action. Better to take a small loss than risk hitting the stop-loss.\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n\n**BTC:** Price $110,109, strong drop from $111,100. RSI(7) crashed to 44.879 from 85.064. Sharp reversal but still above EMA20. Not entering - too volatile.\n\n**ETH:** Price $3,890, similar sharp drop. RSI(7) at 45.165. Neutral positioning around EMA20. Not entering.\n\n**SOL:** Price $189.29, dropped from $192.03. RSI(7) at 38.006 (oversold). MACD still positive but declining. Not entering.\n\n**XRP:** Price $2.48, showing strength with RSI(7) at 87.315 (extremely overbought). MACD just turned positive. Too extended to enter.\n\n**DOGE:** Price $0.19484, dropped from $0.19724. RSI(7) at 43.865. Neutral. Not entering.\n\n**Overall Market Assessment:** All major coins showing sharp reversals in the last candle, suggesting a coordinated pullback.

RSI dropped sharply from overbought (73.955) to weak (40.717) in just 2 candles\n2. Price retracing from $193.88 high back to $191.76\n3. Below-average volume suggests weak buying support\n4. MACD declining but still positive\n5. Price still above key support levels and invalidation condition NOT met\n\nWhile the momentum has weakened significantly, the invalidation condition has not been triggered. The price is still above the $188.50 invalidation level and above the $189.00 stop-loss. Given that we're only down $50 (-0.62%) and the technical invalidation hasn't occurred, I should HOLD but monitor closely.\n\n### Other Coins Assessment\n\n**XRP**: \n- Extremely overbought with RSI (7) at 98.295 and RSI (14) at 93.376\n- Strong uptrend: $2.41 \u2192 $2.60 in 10 candles\n- MACD positive and accelerating (0.044)\n- Price well above EMA20 ($2.47)\n- High volume (6.996M vs 5.587M average)\n- **Risk**: Dangerously overbought, high probability of sharp reversal\n- **Decision**: Too risky to enter at these extreme levels\n\n**BTC**:\n- Price: $111,396, above EMA20 ($110,148.63)\n- RSI (7): 63.664 - healthy, not overbought\n- MACD: 936.413 - strong positive momentum\n- Recent consolidation after spike to $111,635\n- **Decision**: Uptrend intact but already extended, no clear entry\n\n**ETH**:\n- Price: $3,933.30, above EMA20 ($3,896.14)\n- RSI (7): 57.474 - neutral\n- MACD: 27.425 - positive but slight decline\n- Consolidating in range\n- **Decision**: No clear setup\n\n**BNB**:\n- Price: $1,108, near EMA20 ($1,104.95)\n- RSI (7): 38.957 - weak\n- MACD declining (9.514)\n- Showing weakness after rejection from $1,134.90\n- **Decision**: Bearish momentum, avoid\n\n**DOGE**:\n- Price: $0.196120, near EMA20 ($0.195192)\n- RSI (7): 37.035 - weak\n- Retracing from highs\n- **Decision**: Weak momentum, avoid\n\n## Risk Management\n- Current account value: $9,960.25\n- Available cash: $9,514.53\n- SOL position notional: $7,440.28 (74.7% of account)\n- Already at significant exposure with one position\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 38.8,\n      \"profit_target\": 198.5,\n      \"stop_loss\": 189.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 188.50 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown of support and momentum failure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

With RSI at 81.663, this is an extreme overbought condition. The position has gained 2.5% with 15x leverage, which is excellent risk-adjusted return.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n1. RSI above 80 typically signals imminent pullback\n2. Profit target nearly reached\n3. 15x leverage means small reversals can quickly erode gains\n4. Invalidation condition NOT met (price well above $188.50)\n5. The last candle shows parabolic move - often followed by retracement\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION**\nReasoning: Take profits near target with extreme overbought conditions. The RSI at 81.663 is dangerously high, and we're within 0.36% of our profit target. With 15x leverage, it's prudent to lock in the +$183 gain rather than risk a reversal. This is textbook profit-taking at technical resistance with overbought momentum.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC: RSI 86.757 - Extremely overbought, no position\n- ETH: RSI 85.973 - Extremely overbought, no position  \n- BNB: RSI 86.271 - Extremely overbought, no position\n- XRP: RSI 94.001 - CRITICALLY overbought, no position\n- DOGE: RSI 80.480 - Extremely overbought, no position\n\nAll coins showing extreme overbought conditions.

The market is in a strong uptrend but needs consolidation before safe entries present themselves.\n\nIf I were forced to enter, BNB shows the least extreme conditions (RSI 70-80 range), but even this is not ideal.\n\n**Decision**: Stay in cash and wait for better risk/reward setups.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

While invalidation condition is not technically met, the extreme overbought RSI(7) at 90.921 suggests high probability of reversal. Better to lock in +2.82% gain than risk giving it back. This is prudent risk management.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC: RSI(7) 92.759 - Extremely overbought, no position\n- ETH: RSI(7) 94.042 - Extremely overbought, no position  \n- BNB: RSI(7) 83.345 - Overbought, no position\n- XRP: RSI(7) 59.805 - Neutral, no position\n- DOGE: RSI(7) 84.698 - Overbought, no position\n\nAll major coins showing extreme overbought conditions.

This provides the best risk/reward entry point with:\n- Healthy technical setup\n- Price above rising EMA20\n- Positive MACD\n- Room to run before hitting extreme overbought levels\n- Lower risk of immediate reversal compared to BTC/ETH\n\nI'll enter a conservative position in XRP with tight risk management given the overall market frothiness.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2500,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.85,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.52,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.52 (below EMA20) or RSI(7) drops below 40 indicating momentum failure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 412.50\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

While momentum has cooled (RSI dropped from 94+ to 50), this is healthy consolidation rather than a bearish reversal. The price is holding above key support at EMA20 ($2.58) and well above our stop-loss. The MACD remains positive, suggesting the uptrend structure is intact. Given that:\n1. No invalidation conditions are triggered\n2. Stop-loss not hit\n3. Profit target not reached\n4.

The invalidation condition specifically mentions \"RSI(7) drops below 40 indicating momentum failure\" - the momentum failure is evident in the magnitude of the drop. With RSI this close to invalidation and showing such weakness, it's prudent to exit before hitting the hard stop-loss. This is defensive risk management.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC: RSI(7) at 34.819 (oversold), but sharp pullback from $115,566 to $114,111. Not entering on weakness.\n- ETH: RSI(7) at 39.129 (oversold), similar pullback pattern. Not entering.\n- SOL: RSI(7) at 36.495 (oversold), consolidating. No clear setup.\n- BNB: RSI(7) at 40.852, rejected from $1,180 high. No position.\n- DOGE: RSI(7) at 27.307 (extremely oversold), but in downtrend.

RSI(7) at 30 suggests oversold bounce potential, but MACD declining indicates weakening momentum. Price holding above EMA20 is constructive. This could be a healthy retracement in an uptrend.\n\n**Decision:** PASS - Wait for clearer reversal signal.

Lacking momentum.\n\n**Decision:** PASS - No edge in this setup.\n\n### DOGE (Current: $0.19957)\n**Technical Analysis:**\n- Price BELOW EMA20 ($0.20088) - bearish\n- RSI(7): 23.7 - deeply oversold\n- RSI(14): 39.8 - oversold\n- MACD: 0.001 - minimal momentum\n- Sharp decline from $0.2068 to $0.1996 (-3.5%)\n\n**Assessment:** Most oversold of all coins but price below EMA20 is concerning. Could bounce but structure is weak.\n\n**Decision:** PASS - Below key moving average. Wait for reclaim of EMA20.\n\n## Final Decision\n**Opening 1 position: SOL**\n- SOL shows the best technical setup with relative strength\n- Already bounced from oversold, RSI healthy at 62\n- Clear support/resistance levels for risk management\n- Risk: ~$500 (5% of portfolio)\n- Leverage: 15x for optimal risk/reward\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 37,\n      \"profit_target\": 208.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 196.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $196.00 on 3-minute candle, breaking below recent support and EMA20 structure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

This presents potential mean reversion opportunities. The most extreme oversold conditions are:\n1. DOGE: RSI(7) = 7.266\n2. ETH: RSI(7) = 11.565\n3. BNB: RSI(7) = 12.382\n\n**Strategy:** Enter mean reversion trades on the most oversold assets (ETH and DOGE) with tight stop-losses below recent lows. These extreme RSI readings historically lead to short-term bounces.\n\n**ETH Trade Setup:**\n- Entry: $3,978\n- Profit Target: $4,150 (4.3% gain, near EMA20 resistance)\n- Stop Loss: $3,900 (2% below entry, below psychological support)\n- Invalidation: If RSI(7) drops below 10 or price breaks $3,900\n- Risk: ~$500 per position\n- Leverage: 15x for amplified returns on bounce\n\n**DOGE Trade Setup:**\n- Entry: $0.19356\n- Profit Target: $0.20200 (4.4% gain, near EMA20)\n- Stop Loss: $0.19000 (1.8% below entry)\n- Invalidation: If RSI(7) stays below 5 or breaks $0.19000\n- Risk: ~$500 per position\n- Leverage: 15x\n\nBoth trades are counter-trend mean reversion plays betting on oversold bounces.

RSI(7) is above 10 and price is above $3,900. Position showing small profit and oversold conditions suggest potential bounce.\n\n## DOGE Position Analysis\n- **Entry**: $0.19356 | **Current**: $0.19290 | **PnL**: -$10.44 (-0.39%)\n- **Stop-loss**: $0.19000 | **Profit target**: $0.20200\n- **Invalidation condition**: \"If RSI(7) remains below 5 or price closes below $0.19000 on 3-minute candle\"\n- **Current RSI(7)**: 6.467\n- **Price action**: Currently at $0.19290, above $0.19000 stop-loss\n- **Technical analysis**:\n  - RSI(7) at 6.467 - EXTREMELY oversold (was 7.271, now 6.467)\n  - RSI(14) at 19.248 - severely oversold\n  - Price at $0.19290, dangerously close to stop-loss at $0.19000 (only $29 buffer)\n  - MACD negative at -0.001, bearish momentum\n  - Price well below EMA20 ($0.198812)\n  - Volume very low (7.29M vs avg 22.2M)\n- **Critical assessment**: RSI(7) is hovering just above 5 (at 6.467). The invalidation says \"remains below 5\" - it's not below 5 currently, but it's extremely close and showing continued weakness. Price hasn't closed below $0.19000 yet.\n- **Decision**: **HOLD** - Technically, invalidation condition is NOT met (RSI is 6.467, not below 5, and price hasn't closed below $0.19000). However, this is extremely risky. The extreme oversold condition (RSI 6.467) could lead to a bounce, which is the only reason to hold. Will monitor closely.\n\n## Market Overview for Other Coins\n- **BTC**: RSI(7) at 16.001 - extremely oversold, but no position\n- **SOL**: RSI(7) at 16.824 - extremely oversold, but no position  \n- **BNB**: RSI(7) at 15.992 - extremely oversold, but no position\n- **XRP**: RSI(7) at 29.076 - oversold, but no position\n\nAll major coins showing extreme oversold conditions, suggesting potential market-wide bounce or continued capitulation. Given existing positions and risk management, will not add new positions.\n\n## Risk Management Summary\n- Current account value: $10,099.66\n- Total exposure: $4,180.84 (ETH $1,518.82 + DOGE $2,662.02)\n- Available cash: $9,824.95\n- Both positions slightly underwater or small profit\n- Portfolio at 1.00% return with Sharpe 0.787\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.38,\n      \"profit_target\": 4150.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3900.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If RSI(7) drops below 10 or price closes below $3,900 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 13800.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.202,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.19,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If RSI(7) remains below 5 or price closes below $0.19000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

No clear setup.\n- **BNB**: RSI(7) at 24.728 - oversold. Price at $1,098.90 vs EMA20 at $1,125.90. Downtrend continues. No entry.\n- **XRP**: RSI(7) at 45.002 - neutral. Price near EMA20. Consolidating. No clear edge.\n\n**Risk Management Summary**: Both positions are showing losses and are near or approaching stop-loss levels with continued bearish momentum. Market-wide weakness across all coins. Better to preserve capital and wait for clearer setups than hold positions with deteriorating technicals.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.38,\n      \"profit_target\": 4150.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3900.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If RSI(7) drops below 10 or price closes below $3,900 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - price approaching stop-loss ($3,949.50 vs $3,900.00) with strong bearish momentum (MACD -22.625, RSI 19.7).

Let me analyze the market conditions for potential entry opportunities:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $110,675 (down from $114,170 in last 30 minutes)\n- RSI(7): 16.1 - EXTREMELY oversold (below 20)\n- RSI(14): 22.3 - Deeply oversold\n- MACD: -542.5 - Strongly negative and accelerating downward\n- Price below EMA20 ($113,349) by $2,674 (2.4%)\n- Volume spike: 19,763 vs avg 5,889 (3.4x normal) - high selling pressure\n- Assessment: Extreme oversold but momentum still bearish. Catching falling knife risk.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,903 (down from $4,116 in last 30 minutes)\n- RSI(7): 13.6 - EXTREMELY oversold (lowest of all coins)\n- RSI(14): 20.9 - Deeply oversold\n- MACD: -37.2 - Strongly negative\n- Price below EMA20 ($4,047) by $144 (3.6%)\n- Volume spike: 293,984 vs avg 97,748 (3x normal)\n- Assessment: Most oversold coin. High reversal potential but still in downtrend.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $192.75 (down from $202.32)\n- RSI(7): 28.3 - Oversold but not extreme\n- RSI(14): 33.1 - Approaching oversold\n- MACD: -1.235 - Negative but relatively mild\n- Price below EMA20 ($197.74) by $5 (2.5%)\n- Volume spike: 3,017,569 vs avg 819,572 (3.7x normal)\n- Assessment: Oversold but less extreme than BTC/ETH.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,106.70 (down from $1,131.40)\n- RSI(7): 40.8 - Neutral territory\n- RSI(14): 38.2 - Approaching oversold\n- MACD: -8.239 - Negative\n- Price below EMA20 ($1,123.85) by $17 (1.5%)\n- Assessment: Least oversold, showing relative strength.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.59 (down from $2.64)\n- RSI(7): 26.0 - Oversold\n- RSI(14): 33.2 - Approaching oversold\n- MACD: -0.006 - Slightly negative\n- Price below EMA20 ($2.63) by $0.04 (1.5%)\n- Volume spike: 39,409,084 vs avg 9,032,913 (4.4x normal)\n- Assessment: Oversold with massive volume spike.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.1939 (down from $0.2002)\n- RSI(7): 45.3 - Neutral (recovering from extreme oversold)\n- RSI(14): 38.3 - Approaching oversold\n- MACD: -0.003 - Negative\n- Volume spike: 207,817,047 vs avg 33,426,343 (6.2x normal)\n- Assessment: Already bouncing from extreme lows, RSI recovering.\n\n## Trading Decision\n\n**Strategy:** The market is showing extreme oversold conditions across all major coins with massive volume spikes indicating capitulation selling. However, all coins are still in clear downtrends with negative MACD and prices below EMAs. \n\n**Risk Assessment:** This is a high-risk environment. While RSI extremes suggest potential bounces, the momentum is still strongly bearish. I need to be selective and use tight stops.\n\n**Best Opportunity:** ETH shows the most extreme oversold condition (RSI 13.6) with the highest probability of a technical bounce. The risk/reward is favorable for a counter-trend scalp with tight risk management.\n\n**Position Sizing:** Given the high volatility and bearish momentum, I'll use conservative position sizing (~$500 risk, 5% of capital) with 15x leverage for a quick scalp opportunity.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.9,\n      \"profit_target\": 4000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3850.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,850 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) fails to recover above 25 within next 3 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price below $3,850 - NOT MET (currently $3,902)\n2. RSI(7) fails to recover above 25 within next 3 candles - CONCERNING\n\nThe RSI has been struggling and is now at extreme lows (13.487). While technically I should wait for \"next 3 candles\" to confirm failure to recover, the momentum is clearly deteriorating. However, the price hasn't breached $3,850 yet.\n\n**Decision:** HOLD for now, but this is on thin ice. The position is barely above water, and if the next candle shows continued weakness or price approaches $3,850, I should exit. The extreme RSI levels (13.487) suggest we're either near a bounce or about to see capitulation. Given the stop-loss hasn't been hit and we're only down $6, I'll give it one more candle to see if RSI can recover.\n\n## Other Market Opportunities\n\n**BTC:** RSI 13.152 (extreme oversold), but massive downtrend. Too risky to catch falling knife.\n\n**SOL:** RSI 38.638, showing relative strength vs others. Price $193.99 near EMA $197.29. Possible bounce candidate but market too weak overall.\n\n**XRP:** RSI 16.840 (extreme oversold), sharp decline. High risk.\n\n**DOGE:** RSI 36.784, weak but not as oversold. No clear setup.\n\n**BNB:** RSI 41.918, relatively stable. No compelling entry.\n\n**Conclusion:** Market is in severe correction mode. No new positions warranted. Focus on managing existing ETH position carefully.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.9,\n      \"profit_target\": 4000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3850.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,850 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) fails to recover above 25 within next 3 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Looking at recent RSI(7) values: [13.241, 13.091, 36.350] - RSI has recovered from extreme oversold (13.09) to 36.35, showing strong recovery \u2713\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n- RSI(7): 36.35 - Recovered from extreme oversold, showing bullish momentum\n- RSI(14): 30.17 - Still oversold territory, room to run higher\n- MACD: -61.464 - Still negative but improving from -60.165\n- Price vs EMA20: $3,933.40 vs $4,035.59 - Still below EMA but gap narrowing\n- Recent price action: Bounced from $3,902 low to $3,933.40, showing support\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe invalidation condition has NOT been met. ETH has successfully recovered from extreme oversold conditions (RSI was 13.09, now 36.35). Price is holding above the stop-loss level and showing signs of stabilization. The profit target of $4,000 is only $66.60 away (1.7% move), which is achievable given the RSI recovery and oversold bounce pattern.\n\nHowever, I'm concerned about:\n- Still trading below EMA20 ($4,035.59)\n- MACD remains deeply negative (-61.464)\n- Broader market weakness (BTC down significantly)\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Current risk exposure: $7,473 notional at 15x leverage\n- Stop-loss provides protection at $3,850 (2.1% below current)\n- Profit target is reasonable at $4,000 (1.7% above current)\n\n**Conclusion:** HOLD the ETH position. The invalidation condition has not been triggered, RSI has recovered as required, and we're in profit. The setup remains valid with a favorable risk/reward to the $4,000 target.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC, SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE: No positions, and current market conditions show weakness across the board.

The invalidation condition specified \"fails to recover above 25 within next 3 candles\" - this was from entry, and RSI DID recover above 25, so that part of the condition was satisfied.\n\nHowever, the current technical picture is concerning:\n- RSI(7): 21.823 - deeply oversold\n- RSI(14): 22.909 - deeply oversold\n- MACD: -72.489 - strongly negative and worsening\n- Price below EMA20: $3,880.70 vs $4,017.79 (3.4% below)\n- Price action: Downtrend from $4,022.80 to $3,880.70\n- Volume: 28,732 vs avg 95,815 - significantly below average (weak participation)\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Currently $30.70 away from stop-loss ($3,850)\n- Price is in a clear downtrend\n- All momentum indicators are bearish\n- The position is underwater and approaching stop-loss\n- With 15x leverage, a move to $3,850 would trigger stop-loss\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION**\nThe price is dangerously close to the stop-loss level ($30.70 away), and all technical indicators show continued bearish momentum. While the strict invalidation condition hasn't been met (price hasn't closed below $3,850 yet), the risk/reward is poor here. Better to take a small loss now than risk the stop-loss being hit or further deterioration. The RSI is deeply oversold but showing no signs of reversal, and MACD continues to worsen.\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- BTC: RSI(7) 26.909, deeply oversold, but in strong downtrend. Price $109,784 vs EMA20 $112,640. Not entering.\n- SOL: RSI(7) 30.651, oversold, price below EMA20. Weak setup.\n- BNB: RSI(7) 44.348, neutral zone but MACD negative. No clear edge.\n- XRP: RSI(7) 26.486, oversold, downtrending. Not attractive.\n- DOGE: RSI(7) 21.163, deeply oversold, strong downtrend. Too risky.\n\nAll markets showing bearish pressure. No new positions warranted.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.9,\n      \"profit_target\": 4000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3850.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,850 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) fails to recover above 25 within next 3 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - price approaching stop-loss ($30.70 away) with all technical indicators showing continued bearish momentum.

RSI(7) readings below 20 across the board suggest we're near a short-term bottom. However, the strong downtrend momentum (negative MACD, prices below EMAs) means we need to be cautious.\n\n**Best Opportunities (ranked by oversold severity + volume confirmation):**\n1. **DOGE**: RSI(7) 10.70, massive 3.45x volume spike - extreme panic selling\n2. **ETH**: RSI(7) 10.29, 2.22x volume - critically oversold\n3. **XRP**: RSI(7) 12.08, 1.69x volume - severe oversold\n\n**Strategy**: Enter small positions on the most oversold assets with tight stop-losses, anticipating a technical bounce. Use 15x leverage for better risk/reward on mean reversion plays.\n\n**Risk Management**: \n- Limit total exposure to ~$3,000 (30% of capital)\n- Use tight stops (2-3% below entry)\n- Target 5-8% bounces to resistance levels\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 8300,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.1950,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.1760,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.1760 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 30 within next 30 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1000\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.26,\n      \"profit_target\": 3950,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3680,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3680 or fails to reclaim 3850 within next 30 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.70,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1000\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1630,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.60,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.38,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.38 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 25 within next 30 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1000\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price hasn't closed below 0.1760 yet, but RSI condition has failed (it's been 30+ minutes since entry and RSI is at 8, not recovering). However, the extreme oversold conditions (RSI 8) suggest potential bounce. The invalidation is partially met (RSI condition failed).\n- **Decision**: CLOSE - RSI invalidation condition met, and we're at extreme oversold levels with high risk of further cascade\n\n### ETH Position\n- Entry: 3772.7, Current: 3688\n- P&L: -$22.51 (-2.4%)\n- **Invalidation Condition**: \"If price closes below 3680 or fails to reclaim 3850 within next 30 minutes\"\n- **Status**: Price at 3688 is ABOVE 3680 stop-loss (by $8)\n- Has NOT reclaimed 3850 (it's been 30+ minutes)\n- **Analysis**: Price is dangerously close to stop-loss at 3680 (only $8 buffer). The invalidation condition regarding failing to reclaim 3850 has been met. RSI(7) at 6.60 is catastrophically oversold.\n- **Decision**: CLOSE - Invalidation condition met (failed to reclaim 3850), and price is within $8 of stop-loss with extreme downward momentum\n\n### XRP Position\n- Entry: 2.4523, Current: 2.383\n- P&L: -$114.96 (-2.9%)\n- **Invalidation Condition**: \"If price closes below 2.38 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 25 within next 30 minutes\"\n- **Status**: Price at 2.383 is ABOVE 2.38 stop-loss (by 0.003)\n- RSI(7) = 7.73 (has NOT recovered above 25)\n- **Analysis**: Price is essentially AT the stop-loss level (within 0.003). RSI invalidation condition has clearly failed. This is the worst performing position in dollar terms (-$115).\n- **Decision**: CLOSE - Both invalidation conditions effectively met (price at stop-loss, RSI failed to recover)\n\n## Risk Management Assessment\n- Current drawdown: -1.84%\n- All three positions are losing money\n- All positions have met or are very close to meeting invalidation conditions\n- Market shows no signs of stabilization (all RSIs in single digits or low teens)\n- Protecting capital is paramount in this extreme selloff\n\n## New Position Opportunities\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions (RSI 6-12 across all assets), there could be bounce opportunities. However:\n- No clear reversal signals yet (MACD still deeply negative, prices below EMAs)\n- High volatility and risk of further downside\n- Better to preserve capital and wait for confirmation of reversal\n- **Decision**: No new positions at this time\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 8300.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.195,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.176,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.1760 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 30 within next 30 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1000.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation condition met - RSI(7) failed to recover above 30 within timeframe, remains at extreme oversold 8.01.

I need to evaluate whether current market conditions present good entry opportunities.\n\n### Market Overview:\nAll major coins are showing significant bearish pressure:\n- **BTC**: Down from 113K to 108K (-4.2%), RSI 41, deeply below EMA20 (111K), MACD very negative (-1681)\n- **ETH**: Down from 4008 to 3803 (-5.1%), RSI 43, below EMA20 (3949), MACD negative (-96)\n- **SOL**: Down from 198 to 184 (-7.0%), RSI 37, below EMA20 (193), MACD negative (-3.5)\n- **BNB**: Down from 1113 to 1078 (-3.1%), RSI 37, below EMA20 (1108), MACD negative (-14.8)\n- **XRP**: Down from 2.65 to 2.44 (-7.9%), RSI 32, below EMA20 (2.56), MACD negative (-0.052)\n- **DOGE**: Down from 0.195 to 0.182 (-6.7%), RSI 39, below EMA20 (0.191), MACD negative (-0.005)\n\n### Technical Assessment:\n\n**Bearish Signals Across the Board:**\n- All coins trading below their 20-period EMA\n- All MACD indicators are negative and declining\n- RSI values range from 32-43 (oversold territory but not extreme)\n- Recent price action shows sharp selloffs with some minor recovery on latest candle\n- Volume is below average on most coins\n\n**Potential Reversal Signs:**\n- RSI values have bounced from extreme lows (BTC was at 11.7, now 41; ETH was at 6.5, now 43)\n- Latest candles show green recovery bars after steep drops\n- RSI divergence potential - prices made new lows but RSI recovering\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n\n**Against entering positions:**\n1. Strong downtrend across all assets - catching falling knives\n2. All coins below key EMAs indicating bearish momentum\n3. MACD still deeply negative on all coins\n4. No clear reversal confirmation yet\n5. Account already down -1.76%, need to preserve capital\n\n**For entering positions:**\n1. RSI oversold readings suggest potential bounce\n2. Latest candles showing recovery from lows\n3. Risk/reward could be favorable if this is capitulation\n4. Could set tight stops to limit downside\n\n### Decision:\n\nGiven the strong bearish momentum, lack of clear reversal signals, and my current negative performance, I will **NOT enter any new positions** at this time. The market needs to show clearer signs of stabilization before risking capital. All coins are in confirmed downtrends below their EMAs with negative MACD readings.\n\nThe prudent approach is to wait for:\n- Price to reclaim EMA20 levels\n- MACD to show positive divergence or crossover\n- RSI to confirm strength above 50\n- Clear higher lows formation\n\nPreserving capital in uncertain conditions is more important than forcing trades.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",
