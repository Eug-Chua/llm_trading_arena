I need to analyze the market conditions across all coins to identify the best entry opportunities.\n\n## Market Analysis by Coin:\n\n**BTC (Current: $109,160)**\n- Price well below EMA20 ($111,104), indicating downtrend\n- MACD deeply negative (-1,429), showing strong bearish momentum\n- RSI(7) at 43.9 - recovering from oversold but still weak\n- Recent price action: Sharp drop from $111,268 to $108,211, now bouncing to $109,160\n- Volume below average (3,548 vs 7,856) - weak conviction\n- Assessment: In downtrend but showing signs of bottoming. Too early to enter.\n\n**ETH (Current: $3,930.90)**\n- Price below EMA20 ($4,023), bearish structure\n- MACD negative (-71.78), bearish momentum\n- RSI(7) at 45.5 - neutral, recovering from 21.4 low\n- Recent action: Drop from $4,061 to $3,864, now recovering\n- Volume very low (52,185 vs 135,853) - 38% of average\n- Assessment: Weak bounce in downtrend. Not compelling yet.\n\n**SOL (Current: $186.91)**\n- Price significantly below EMA20 ($195.30) - 4.3% gap\n- MACD negative (-5.06), continuing bearish\n- RSI(7) at 35.6 - oversold territory, recovering from 19.0\n- Recent action: Dropped from $197 to $184.76, slight bounce\n- Volume weak (464k vs 1.19M) - only 39% of average\n- Assessment: Oversold but no reversal confirmation yet.\n\n**BNB (Current: $1,149.30)**\n- Price below EMA20 ($1,188) - 3.3% gap\n- MACD negative (-31.54), bearish\n- RSI(7) at 37.8 - oversold, recovering from 13.5 extreme low\n- Recent action: Sharp drop from $1,183 to $1,134, now stabilizing\n- Volume extremely low (4,336 vs 19,293) - only 22% of average\n- Assessment: Oversold but very weak volume, risky entry.\n\n**XRP (Current: $2.36)**\n- Price below EMA20 ($2.44) - 3.3% gap\n- MACD negative (-0.058), bearish\n- RSI(7) at 41.5 - recovering from 20.3 oversold\n- Recent action: Drop from $2.45 to $2.33, bouncing\n- Volume above average (13.08M vs 10.32M) - 127% of average\n- Assessment: **BEST SETUP** - Oversold bounce with above-average volume showing buying interest.\n\n**DOGE (Current: $0.190230)**\n- Price below EMA20 ($0.198261) - 4.0% gap\n- MACD negative (-0.005), bearish\n- RSI(7) at 37.3 - oversold, recovering from 18.5\n- Recent action: Drop from $0.200 to $0.187, slight bounce\n- Volume very low (16.19M vs 67.55M) - only 24% of average\n- Assessment: Oversold but extremely weak volume, avoid.\n\n## Trading Decision:\n\nGiven this is the first trade and all markets are in downtrends, I need to be selective. **XRP** shows the most promising setup:\n1. Oversold RSI recovering from extreme lows (20.3 \u2192 41.5)\n2. **Above-average volume** (127%) indicating genuine buying interest\n3. Clear support forming around $2.33\n4. Smaller gap to EMA20 (3.3%) compared to others\n5. Recent bounce from $2.33 to $2.36 showing momentum\n\nI'll enter a conservative long position on XRP with tight risk management:\n- Entry: $2.36\n- Stop-loss: $2.30 (below recent low of $2.33, -2.5%)\n- Profit target: $2.48 (near EMA20, +5.1%)\n- Risk: 2% of capital = $200\n- Leverage: 15x for optimal position sizing\n- Invalidation: If price closes below $2.30 or RSI(7) drops back below 30\n\nPosition size calculation:\n- Risk per unit: $2.36 - $2.30 = $0.06\n- Units needed: $200 / $0.06 = 3,333 XRP\n- With 15x leverage: 3,333 / 15 = 222 XRP base = $524 margin\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 3333,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.48,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.30,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.30 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 30\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 200.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price well below EMA20 (110,350). This is capitulation-level selling.\n\n**ETH**: Price at 3,756 (down from 4,061), RSI(7) at 20.6 (extreme oversold), RSI(14) at 25.5, MACD at -68.5. Price significantly below EMA20 (3,986).\n\n**SOL**: Price at 177.65 (down from 196.80), RSI(7) at 16.4 (extreme oversold), RSI(14) at 21.5, MACD at -5.3. Massive drop below EMA20 (193.22).\n\n**BNB**: Price at 1,062.60 (down from 1,183.80), RSI(7) at 9.5 (EXTREMELY oversold - lowest of all), RSI(14) at 14.7, MACD at -35. Catastrophic selling pressure.\n\n**XRP**: Price at 2.24 (down from 2.45), RSI(7) at 17.4 (extreme oversold), RSI(14) at 21.1, MACD at -0.059.\n\n**DOGE**: Price at 0.178490 (down from 0.200260), RSI(7) at 14.8 (extreme oversold), RSI(14) at 19.2, MACD at -0.005.\n\n## Current Portfolio Status\n- No open positions\n- Available cash: $9,586.45\n- Account down -4.14% from starting capital\n\n## Trading Decision Rationale\n\nAll assets are showing extreme oversold conditions with RSI(7) readings between 9.5 and 20.6. This represents a potential capitulation event and mean-reversion opportunity. However, the momentum is strongly negative across all timeframes.\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. **Extreme oversold conditions** suggest a bounce is likely, but timing is critical\n2. **All EMAs are far above current prices** - strong downtrend in place\n3. **MACD deeply negative** - momentum still bearish\n4. **Volume elevated** - panic selling in progress\n\n**Risk Management Strategy:**\nGiven the extreme oversold readings, I'll initiate small positions in the most oversold assets (BNB, DOGE, SOL) with tight stop-losses. These are counter-trend trades betting on mean reversion, so position sizing must be conservative.\n\n**BNB** - RSI(7) at 9.5 is the most extreme reading. High probability of short-term bounce.\n**SOL** - RSI(7) at 16.4, strong altcoin with good liquidity.\n**DOGE** - RSI(7) at 14.8, meme coin but extreme oversold suggests bounce potential.\n\nI'll avoid BTC and ETH despite oversold conditions because they're the largest positions and I want to diversify risk. I'll use 15x leverage with strict stop-losses at 3-5% below entry to limit downside while capturing potential 10-15% bounces.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.45,\n      \"profit_target\": 1125.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1020.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1020 or RSI(7) drops below 8 without bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 285.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 9.00,\n      \"profit_target\": 192.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 170 or makes new local low below 175\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 285.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 8500.00,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.195000,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.171000,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.171 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 25 within 5 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 285.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "# CHAIN OF THOUGHT\n\nAnalyzing current market conditions and my three open positions:\n\n## Market Overview\nAll major cryptocurrencies are experiencing significant selling pressure:\n- BTC: Down to 105,671 from 110,730 (-4.6%), RSI(7) at 19.3 (extremely oversold)\n- ETH: Down to 3,777 from 3,983 (-5.2%), RSI(7) at 27.0 (oversold)\n- SOL: Down to 181.47 from 193.71 (-6.3%), RSI(7) at 35.6\n- BNB: Down to 1,071 from 1,162 (-7.8%), RSI(7) at 18.2 (extremely oversold)\n- XRP: Down to 2.28 from 2.41 (-5.4%), RSI(7) at 35.6\n- DOGE: Down to 0.1826 from 0.1959 (-6.8%), RSI(7) at 33.7\n\nThis is a broad market selloff with extreme oversold conditions across the board.\n\n## Position Analysis\n\n### BNB Position (0.45 @ 1062.6, Current: 1071.7)\n- Entry: 1062.6, Current: 1071.7 (+0.86%)\n- Unrealized P&L: +$3.86\n- Stop-loss: 1020.0, Profit target: 1125.0\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below 1020 or RSI(7) drops below 8 without bounce\"\n- Current RSI(7): 18.2 (extremely oversold but above 8)\n- Price action: Bounced from 1062.6 low, now at 1071.7\n\n**Analysis**: This position is barely in profit. The invalidation condition has NOT been met (price is above 1020 and RSI is 18.2, not below 8). However, BNB has shown the weakest performance (-7.8% from recent high) and RSI at 18.2 is dangerously low. The bounce from 1062.6 to 1071.7 is minimal. Given the extreme weakness and proximity to stop-loss (only 4.8% away), this is a high-risk position.\n\n**Decision**: CLOSE - Risk management. While invalidation not technically met, RSI at 18.2 shows extreme weakness, and we're only +0.86% in profit with stop-loss very close. Better to take small profit and preserve capital in this volatile environment.\n\n### SOL Position (9.0 @ 177.65, Current: 181.47)\n- Entry: 177.65, Current: 181.47 (+2.15%)\n- Unrealized P&L: +$33.58\n- Stop-loss: 170.0, Profit target: 192.0\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below 170 or makes new local low below 175\"\n- Current RSI(7): 35.6 (recovering from oversold)\n- Price action: Bounced from 177.65 low to 181.47\n\n**Analysis**: This is my best-performing position. Entry at 177.65 was the exact low of the recent move. Invalidation condition NOT met - price is well above 170 and hasn't made a new low below 175. RSI(7) at 35.6 shows recovery from extreme oversold (was 16.4). Stop-loss at 170 provides 6.3% cushion. Currently up 2.15% with room to run to 192 target (+5.8% more).\n\n**Decision**: HOLD - Position is working well, invalidation not met, good risk/reward to target.\n\n### DOGE Position (8,500 @ 0.17849, Current: 0.18261)\n- Entry: 0.17849, Current: 0.18261 (+2.31%)\n- Unrealized P&L: +$34.26\n- Stop-loss: 0.171, Profit target: 0.195\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below 0.171 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 25 within 5 candles\"\n- Current RSI(7): 33.7 (recovered above 25)\n- Price action: Bounced from 0.17849 low to 0.18261\n\n**Analysis**: Good position. Entry at 0.17849 caught the low. Invalidation NOT met - price above 0.171 and RSI has recovered to 33.7 (well above 25 threshold). Currently up 2.31% with profit target at 0.195 (+6.8% more from current). Stop-loss at 0.171 provides 6.2% cushion.\n\n**Decision**: HOLD - Position working, invalidation not met, good setup.\n\n## New Position Opportunities\n\n### BTC (Current: 105,671)\n- RSI(7): 19.3 (extremely oversold - lowest reading)\n- RSI(14): 23.5 (oversold)\n- MACD: -1264 (deeply negative but may be bottoming)\n- Price below EMA20 (109,664) by 3.8%\n\n**Analysis**: Extremely oversold but in strong downtrend. Too risky to enter against this momentum.\n\n**Decision**: NO TRADE - Wait for stabilization.\n\n### ETH, XRP\nSimilar oversold conditions but in downtrends. Not entering against momentum.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.45,\n      \"profit_target\": 1125.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1020.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1020 or RSI(7) drops below 8 without bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 285.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - RSI at extreme 18.2 showing severe weakness, only +0.86% profit with stop-loss 4.8% away, weakest performer in portfolio, preserving capital in volatile market\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 9.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 192.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 170 or makes new local low below 175\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 285.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 8500.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.195,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.171,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.171 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 25 within 5 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 285.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price showing strength relative to entry.\n\n## Risk Management Assessment\n- **Current Account Value**: $9,692.33\n- **Total Unrealized P&L**: +$97.46 (+1.01% on open positions)\n- **Overall Return**: -3.08% (from initial drawdown, now recovering)\n- **Position Exposure**: SOL $1,644.66 + DOGE $1,570.38 = $3,215.04 notional (33% of account)\n- **Both positions are profitable and showing resilience in a down market**\n\n## New Position Opportunities\nGiven the severe market selloff, I'm evaluating oversold bounce opportunities:\n- **BNB**: RSI(7) at 20.8 - extremely oversold, but momentum still negative\n- **ETH**: RSI(7) at 33.9 - oversold but not extreme\n- **BTC**: RSI(7) at 39.6 - approaching oversold\n\n**Decision on new positions**: **NONE** - While oversold conditions exist, the market is showing strong bearish momentum with all coins below their EMA20s and negative MACD readings. Better to preserve capital and manage existing profitable positions rather than catch a falling knife. The trend remains down across all timeframes.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 9.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 192.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 170 or makes new local low below 175\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 285.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 8500.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.195,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.171,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.171 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 25 within 5 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 285.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The position is profitable but hasn't reached profit target of 192. RSI shows oversold conditions which could lead to a bounce. However, price remains below EMA20 and MACD is negative, indicating continued bearish pressure. The invalidation condition has NOT been met - price has not closed below 170 and has not made a new local low below 175 (current low is 177.65).\n\n**Decision**: HOLD - Invalidation condition not met, position still valid with room to run to profit target.\n\n## DOGE Position Analysis\n- Entry: 0.17849, Current: 0.18472 (+3.49%)\n- Unrealized PnL: +$52.20\n- Exit plan: Profit target 0.195, Stop-loss 0.171\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below 0.171 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 25 within 5 candles\"\n- Current RSI(7): 43.47, RSI(14): 37.23\n- MACD: -0.005 (negative but stabilizing)\n- Price action: Bounced from 0.17849 low, currently at 0.18472\n- EMA20: 0.191412 (price below EMA, bearish)\n\n**Analysis**: Price is well above stop-loss at 0.171 and entry at 0.17849. RSI(7) has recovered to 43.47, well above 25, so the RSI recovery condition has been met. The position is profitable but hasn't reached profit target of 0.195. Price remains below EMA20 indicating bearish trend, but RSI shows recovery from oversold levels. The invalidation condition has NOT been met - price is above 0.171 and RSI has recovered above 25.\n\n**Decision**: HOLD - Invalidation condition not met, RSI recovery is positive, position still valid.\n\n## Other Coins (BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP)\n- BTC: RSI(7) 35.05, heavily oversold, MACD very negative (-1589), price below EMA20\n- ETH: RSI(7) 45.61, MACD negative (-73.77), price below EMA20\n- BNB: RSI(7) 25.06, extremely oversold, MACD very negative (-33.56), price below EMA20\n- XRP: RSI(7) 39.82, MACD negative (-0.050), price below EMA20\n\nAll major coins are showing bearish trends with prices below EMA20 and negative MACD.

The invalidation condition is NOT met. Price has been making higher lows (177.65 \u2192 181.47 \u2192 181.89 \u2192 184.74 \u2192 186.04). RSI showing strength at 63.4.\n\n**Decision**: HOLD - Position is working well, up 4.72%, no invalidation conditions met, momentum positive.\n\n## DOGE Position Analysis\n- Entry: 0.17849, Current: 0.18787 (+5.25%)\n- Unrealized PnL: +$78.97\n- Exit Plan: Profit target 0.195, Stop-loss 0.171\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below 0.171 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 25 within 5 candles\"\n- Current RSI(7): 61.923 (healthy bullish)\n- MACD: -0.004 (nearly neutral, improving)\n- Price action: Recovery from 0.17849 low, now at 0.18787\n- EMA20: 0.190625 (price slightly below but converging)\n\n**Invalidation Check**: Price is at 0.18787, well above 0.171 stop-loss. RSI(7) is at 61.923, far above the 25 threshold mentioned in invalidation. The RSI recovery condition was met several candles ago (RSI went from 14.182 to current 61.923). No invalidation conditions met.\n\n**Decision**: HOLD - Position performing well, up 5.25%, strong RSI recovery, no exit conditions triggered.\n\n## Other Coins (BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP)\nNo positions currently. Reviewing for potential entries:\n\n**BTC**: Price 107171, below EMA20 (108447), MACD negative (-1441), RSI(7) 54.7. Showing some recovery but still in downtrend structure. Not compelling enough for entry.\n\n**ETH**: Price 3880.70, below EMA20 (3917), MACD negative (-61.5), RSI(7) 59.98. Similar to BTC - recovering but not strong enough setup.\n\n**BNB**: Price 1102.80, below EMA20 (1123), MACD negative (-24.9), RSI(7) 54.3. Weak structure, no entry signal.\n\n**XRP**: Price 2.38, above EMA20 (2.37), MACD negative (-0.039), RSI(7) 75.4. Interesting - price crossed above EMA, RSI very strong at 75.4, MACD improving. However, RSI at 75.4 suggests overbought conditions and potential for pullback. Too risky to enter at these levels.\n\n**Risk Management**: Currently have 2 positions totaling ~$3,271 notional ($1,674 SOL + $1,597 DOGE). Both positions are profitable and showing positive momentum. Portfolio is well-balanced with available cash of $9,380. No need to force new entries.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 9.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 192.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 170 or makes new local low below 175\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 285.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 8500.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.195,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.171,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.171 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 25 within 5 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 285.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price remains above $3,850 and is showing signs of stabilization. The MACD is improving, RSI is neutral, and we're very close to EMA20. The position is only slightly underwater and all exit conditions remain intact. This is a normal intraday fluctuation within our risk parameters.\n\n**Conclusion:** HOLD the ETH position. The trade thesis remains valid, invalidation condition not triggered, and technical indicators suggest potential for recovery toward profit target.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** Price at $106,726, below EMA20 ($107,771), RSI 36 (oversold), MACD improving but negative. Downtrend but showing signs of bottoming. Not entering - prefer to see confirmation of reversal.\n\n**SOL:** Price $185.81, near EMA20 ($186.66), RSI 47.79 (neutral), MACD improving. Consolidating but no clear setup.\n\n**BNB:** Price $1,083.90, well below EMA20 ($1,110.92), RSI 35.47 (oversold), weak momentum. Downtrend continues.\n\n**XRP:** Price $2.35, at EMA20, RSI 45.27 (neutral), MACD near zero. Choppy, no clear direction.\n\n**DOGE:** Price $0.18869, slightly below EMA20 ($0.18919), RSI 50.62 (neutral), MACD improving.

Price is approaching the profit target ($195.00), only $3.86 away. The technical indicators remain bullish:\n- Strong RSI without being extremely overbought\n- Positive MACD momentum\n- Price well above EMA20\n- Above-average volume supporting the move\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious as we're 8 minutes into trading and RSI(7) at 70.361 suggests we're in overbought territory (though not extreme). The position is up 1.23% unleveraged (15x leverage = ~18.5% on capital deployed).\n\nGiven that:\n1. No invalidation conditions are met\n2. Profit target is close but not yet hit\n3. Momentum remains positive\n4. Stop-loss provides adequate protection\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - Continue riding the momentum toward the $195 profit target with stop-loss protection at $184.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** RSI(7) 86.833 - Extremely overbought, price at $110,100 with strong momentum but risk of pullback. No position, not entering at these extreme levels.\n\n**ETH:** RSI(7) 90.328 - Dangerously overbought, highest reading of all coins. Strong uptrend but overextended. Not entering.\n\n**BNB:** RSI(7) 73.779 - Overbought but recovering. MACD still negative at -3.650. Mixed signals, avoiding.\n\n**XRP:** RSI(7) 80.881 - Overbought. Strong momentum but late to enter.\n\n**DOGE:** RSI(7) 81.814 - Overbought. Strong rally but overextended.\n\nAll major coins are showing overbought conditions. With only one position (SOL) that's performing well and approaching target, the prudent approach is to manage this position carefully rather than chase overextended moves in other assets.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 40.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 184.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $184.00 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 40 indicating momentum loss\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

We're very close to the profit target ($195.00), just 1.07% away. The momentum remains strong with positive MACD and healthy RSI levels. The invalidation condition has NOT been triggered - price is well above $184 and RSI(7) is at 77, far above the 40 threshold.\n\nHowever, given we're so close to the profit target and RSI is showing elevated levels (77), there's a case for taking profits. But since the invalidation condition is not met and momentum remains positive, I'll hold to reach the profit target.\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- **BTC**: RSI(7) at 91.207 - extremely overbought, risky entry\n- **ETH**: RSI(7) at 92.913 - extremely overbought, risky entry  \n- **BNB**: RSI(7) at 67.344, MACD negative (-2.830) - mixed signals\n- **XRP**: RSI(7) at 87.651 - very overbought\n- **DOGE**: RSI(7) at 86.119 - very overbought\n\nAll other coins show overbought conditions with elevated RSI levels.

Sharp RSI decline from overbought (77.6) to neutral (50.5) in 6 minutes\n2. Price pulling back from $192.93 high\n3. MACD declining despite still being positive\n4. RSI(7) at 50.532 is dangerously close to the psychological 50 level\n5. If momentum continues to fade, we could quickly approach the invalidation RSI level of 40\n\nWhile the strict invalidation conditions haven't been met yet, the rapid momentum deterioration suggests we're at risk. The position is up only $60 (+0.85%), which is minimal given the 15x leverage and risk exposure.\n\n**DECISION: CLOSE POSITION** - Taking profits and protecting capital due to rapid momentum loss. While invalidation isn't technically met, the sharp RSI decline from 77.6 to 50.5 signals weakening momentum that could quickly deteriorate further.\n\n## Other Coins Analysis\n\n### BTC\n- Price: $111,100 (strong rally)\n- RSI(7): 86.550 - Extremely overbought\n- MACD: 1227.759 - Very strong momentum\n- Above EMA20 by significant margin\n- **No position, not entering** - Too extended, high risk of pullback\n\n### ETH\n- Price: $4,003.10\n- RSI(7): 52.543 - Cooling from overbought\n- RSI(14): 65.101 - Declining rapidly\n- MACD: 59.060 - Declining\n- **No position, not entering** - Momentum fading after overbought run\n\n### BNB\n- Price: $1,110.10\n- RSI(7): 43.947 - Weak momentum\n- MACD: 10.849 - Declining\n- **No position, not entering** - Weak momentum, no clear setup\n\n### XRP\n- Price: $2.46\n- RSI(7): 77.225 - Overbought\n- MACD: 0.041 - Positive but small\n- **No position, not entering** - Overbought, risk of reversal\n\n### DOGE\n- Price: $0.199280\n- RSI(7): 65.052 - Declining from overbought\n- MACD: 0.004 - Positive but weakening\n- **No position, not entering** - Momentum fading\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 40.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 184.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $184.00 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 40 indicating momentum loss\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Rapid momentum deterioration - RSI(7) dropped from 77.6 to 50.5 in 2 candles, indicating weakening bullish momentum and increased risk of approaching invalidation condition.

Price remains well above the $0.192 stop-loss level and above EMA20 support. While RSI shows overbought conditions, MACD remains positive and the uptrend is intact. The position is performing as expected with a favorable risk/reward setup. Will continue to monitor for either profit target ($0.215) or stop-loss ($0.192) to be hit.\n\n**Other coins:**\nNo positions in BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, or XRP. Market conditions show mixed signals across the board. BTC and XRP show strength, but with limited capital ($9,346 available) and one position already open, I'll maintain focus on the existing DOGE trade rather than spreading risk further.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 39000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.215,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.192,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.19200 on 3-minute candle (EMA20 support break)\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Current price 0.196520 > 0.19200\n5. **Stop-loss Distance**: Stop at 0.192 is only 2.3% away - getting close but not hit yet\n6. **MACD**: Still positive at 0.004, showing some bullish structure remains\n7. **Volume**: Current volume 10M vs average 18.3M - lower volume on this decline\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe invalidation condition has NOT been met - price is still above 0.19200 and above EMA20 support. However, the sharp RSI drop to 33.772 (oversold territory) and the proximity to stop-loss (only 2.3% away) are concerning. The position is down but not critically so.\n\nGiven that:\n- Invalidation NOT triggered (price > 0.19200)\n- Stop-loss NOT hit (price > 0.192)\n- RSI oversold (33.772) suggests potential bounce\n- Price still above EMA20 support\n- MACD still positive\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - The exit conditions have not been met. The oversold RSI actually suggests a potential bounce opportunity. Will maintain position and let the stop-loss protect if price continues lower.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB: All showing RSI weakness (20-26 range) after recent highs - not attractive entries\n- XRP: RSI 45, showing relative strength but no compelling setup\n- No new positions warranted given current market weakness across the board\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 39000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.215,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.192,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.19200 on 3-minute candle (EMA20 support break)\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, examining the technical indicators:\n\n1. **RSI (7-period): 22.808** - Extremely oversold, suggesting potential bounce\n2. **RSI (14-period): 41.279** - Still in bearish territory\n3. **MACD: 0.003** - Weakening but still positive\n4. **EMA20: 0.194759** - Price is below EMA20 (bearish)\n5. **Recent price action**: Sharp decline from 0.19995 to 0.194160 in last candle\n\n**Key Concern:** The price is dangerously close to the stop-loss at 0.192 (only 0.002160 away, or ~1.1%). The invalidation condition states \"closes below 0.19200\" - we haven't closed below that yet, but we're teetering on the edge.\n\n**Risk Management Decision:**\nGiven:\n- We're down $213 on this position\n- Price is only 1.1% above our stop-loss\n- RSI is extremely oversold (22.808), which could signal a bounce\n- We haven't technically violated the invalidation condition yet\n- The position is at 15x leverage, making it high-risk\n\nI will **HOLD** for now since the invalidation condition has NOT been met (price hasn't closed below 0.192). The extreme RSI oversold reading suggests we might see a bounce.

Let me check the technical indicators:\n\n- RSI (7-period): 34.868 - oversold territory, showing weakness\n- RSI (14-period): 42.125 - below neutral, bearish\n- MACD: 0.002 - weakening momentum\n- Current price vs EMA20: 0.193850 vs 0.196270 - trading BELOW EMA20 by 1.23%\n- Price action: Recent candles show 0.204240 \u2192 0.201490 \u2192 0.193850 (sharp decline)\n\n**Key Concern:** The price is trading below the EMA20 (0.196270) and approaching the invalidation level (0.192). The position is down $225 and showing continued weakness. The RSI is in oversold territory but without bullish divergence or reversal signals.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Current price is only 0.00185 (0.95%) above the invalidation level\n- Stop-loss at 0.192 is very close (0.00185 away)\n- The trend is clearly bearish with lower highs and lower lows\n- Volume is elevated (58M vs 25M average), suggesting strong selling pressure\n\n**Decision:** CLOSE POSITION\nThe invalidation condition hasn't technically been met yet (price hasn't closed below 0.19200), but the position is in serious danger. The price is below EMA20, RSI shows weakness, and we're very close to the stop-loss. Given the sharp decline from 0.204240 to 0.193850 in just 3 candles, the momentum is clearly against us. It's prudent to exit now with a manageable loss rather than risk hitting the stop-loss or invalidation level.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP: All showing similar bearish patterns with RSI in oversold territory (30s-40s range), prices below EMA20, and declining MACD. Market conditions are unfavorable for new entries.

Recent sharp selloffs (4-5.6% drops)\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Given my negative Sharpe ratio (-5.922) and -3.64% return, I need to be cautious\n- All markets are in synchronized downtrends\n- Oversold conditions could lead to bounces, but catching falling knives is risky\n- No clear reversal signals yet (need to see price reclaim EMA20 or bullish divergence)\n\n**Strategy:**\nGiven the current market conditions with all assets in downtrends and my poor performance so far, I will **NOT enter any new positions**. The oversold readings suggest potential bounces, but without confirmation of trend reversal (price above EMA20, bullish MACD crossover), the risk is too high. Better to wait for clearer entry signals rather than force trades in a falling market.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

All coins are showing oversold conditions after sharp drops, but:\n\n**Key concerns:**\n1. All coins trading below their EMA20 (bearish trend)\n2. Low volume on most coins (except SOL and DOGE)\n3. MACD declining across the board\n4. Recent sharp drops suggest potential further downside\n\n**Opportunity:**\n- Multiple oversold RSI readings suggest potential mean reversion\n- SOL and DOGE have better relative volume\n- Risk/reward could be favorable for a quick bounce trade\n\n**Strategy:**\nI'll take ONE selective position in SOL due to:\n1. RSI(7) at 34.24 (oversold but not extreme)\n2. Better volume retention (87% of average)\n3. Tight stop-loss possible due to recent low at $184.90\n4. Risk management: Only risking ~$500 (5% of capital)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 26,\n      \"profit_target\": 191.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 182.50,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $182.50 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 25 indicating further capitulation\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 624.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The position is protected by a tight stop-loss at $182.50, and RSI(7) at 34.975 is still well above the invalidation threshold of 25.

RSI(7) has dropped below 15 (currently 17.066, but was likely below 15 recently based on the trajectory). However, at these extreme oversold levels (RSI 17), there's potential for a bounce. The price is still $2.50 above stop-loss. Given the extreme oversold condition and that we're only down 0.09%, I'll give it one more candle to see if we get the bounce. But this is on thin ice.\n\n**Action**: HOLD (but monitoring closely - if next candle shows continued weakness, must close)\n\n### XRP Position Analysis\n- **Entry**: $2.3762 | **Current**: $2.3634 | **PnL**: -$220.31 (-0.54%)\n- **Stop-Loss**: $2.35 | **Profit Target**: $2.43\n- **Invalidation Condition**: \"If price closes below $2.35 or MACD continues declining below -0.01\"\n\n**Technical Analysis**:\n- Current price: $2.3634 (above stop-loss of $2.35 by only $0.0134)\n- RSI(7): 18.914 - CRITICALLY OVERSOLD\n- RSI(14): 31.533 - Oversold\n- MACD: -0.008 (negative and at the invalidation threshold)\n- Price below EMA20 ($2.42) - bearish\n- Price action: Declining from $2.52 to $2.36\n\n**Invalidation Check**:\n- Price at $2.3634 is ABOVE stop-loss of $2.35 by only $0.0134 (1.4 cents) \u2713 (barely)\n- MACD at -0.008 is ABOVE -0.01 threshold \u2713 (barely)\n- However, MACD trend: -0.003 \u2192 -0.008 (declining toward invalidation)\n\n**Decision**: This position is EXTREMELY CLOSE to invalidation. We're only 1.4 cents above stop-loss and MACD is approaching the -0.01 invalidation level. The trend is clearly bearish with RSI at 18.914 showing extreme selling pressure. Risk/reward is poor here - we're risking further losses for minimal upside given the weak technicals.\n\n**Action**: CLOSE POSITION - Risk management dictates exit. Too close to stop-loss, MACD approaching invalidation, and extreme oversold without bounce signals.\n\n### Other Coins (No Positions)\n- **BTC**: RSI 34.6, below EMA, MACD negative - bearish, no entry\n- **ETH**: RSI 26.2, deeply oversold, MACD negative - bearish, no entry\n- **BNB**: RSI 44.5, below EMA, MACD negative - neutral/bearish, no entry\n- **DOGE**: RSI 25.3, oversold, MACD negative - bearish, no entry\n\nAll major coins showing weakness.

SOL has rallied strongly from the $180 low and is now approaching my profit target of $195\n2. RSI at 80.6 is dangerously overbought - this typically precedes pullbacks\n3. Price is well above the invalidation level ($179.50), so the position remains valid\n4. The position is up 15.74% - excellent return, but RSI suggests momentum may be exhausting\n5. Only $3.96 away from profit target vs $11.54 away from stop-loss (risk/reward now unfavorable)\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nGiven the extreme RSI reading (80.6), the proximity to my profit target ($195), and the strong unrealized gain (+$1,202), I should consider taking profits. However, the invalidation condition has NOT been met (price is well above $179.50), and the trend remains bullish with price above EMA20.\n\nThe prudent approach is to HOLD and let the position reach the profit target at $195, which is only 2% away. The stop-loss at $179.50 protects against downside risk. The invalidation condition is clear and has not been triggered.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC: RSI 73.5 (overbought), but strong momentum. No position, not entering at these levels.\n- ETH: RSI 61.5, MACD improving but still negative. Below EMA20. Not compelling.\n- BNB: RSI 77.7 (overbought), strong rally. No position, too late to enter.\n- XRP: RSI 58.1, consolidating. Weak setup.\n- DOGE: RSI 70.7 (overbought), small gains.

However:\n- Invalidation condition is NOT met (price far above $179.50)\n- Strong upward momentum continues\n- Profit target is close ($195.00, only $3.87 away)\n- MACD improving suggests momentum may continue briefly\n\nGiven the extreme RSI reading and proximity to profit target, I should **HOLD** but be ready for the profit target to hit soon. The invalidation condition is clear and not triggered. Taking profits prematurely would violate the trading plan.\n\n### Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC**: \n- RSI 77.352 - overbought but strong uptrend\n- Price $110,233 above EMA20 $109,405\n- MACD improving (-350 from -828)\n- No position, but momentum is strong. However, RSI near 80 suggests limited upside.\n\n**ETH**:\n- RSI 50.072 - neutral\n- Price $3,859 below EMA20 $3,890 - still bearish structure\n- MACD -35.174 (negative but improving)\n- Weak setup, no entry signal\n\n**BNB**:\n- RSI 63.613 - healthy bullish\n- Price $1,117 above EMA20 $1,094\n- MACD turned positive (+1.424)\n- Interesting but late to the move\n\n**XRP**:\n- RSI 56.558 - neutral\n- Price $2.41 below EMA20 $2.42\n- Choppy, no clear direction\n\n**DOGE**:\n- RSI 72.899 - overbought\n- Price $0.1958 above EMA20 $0.1948\n- Similar to SOL, late in the move\n\n**Portfolio Risk Management**:\n- Current account value: $11,979.13\n- Available cash: $5,643.92\n- SOL position notional: $76,452 (15x leverage on ~$5,097 margin)\n- Current return: +19.79% (excellent)\n- Sharpe ratio: 3.571 (very strong risk-adjusted returns)\n\nWith one highly profitable position showing extreme overbought conditions, the prudent approach is to **HOLD** and let the profit target work, rather than exit prematurely.

BNB shows strength (above EMA, positive MACD, RSI 68.7) but is also getting overbought.

More importantly, I need to check if the invalidation condition has been met:\n\nLooking at the recent price action:\n- Latest 3-minute candle closed at $1,103.40\n- Previous candle: $1,124.80\n- This represents a sharp drop of $21.40 in one 3-minute period\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n- RSI (7-period): 34.252 - showing oversold conditions and bearish momentum\n- RSI (14-period): 47.732 - below neutral, confirming weakness\n- MACD: 11.902 - still positive but this is a lagging indicator\n- Price vs EMA20: $1,103.40 vs $1,101.46 - barely above EMA20 support\n- Recent price action shows a sharp rejection from $1,134.90 high\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nThe position is currently at -2.77% loss with only $3.40 cushion to stop-loss. The RSI has plummeted from 59.527 to 34.252, indicating strong selling pressure. While the price hasn't technically closed below $1,100 yet, it's extremely close and the momentum is clearly bearish.\n\n**Decision:** CLOSE POSITION\nReasoning: The invalidation condition states \"if price closes below $1,100\" - while we're at $1,103.40, the extreme proximity to this level combined with:\n1. Sharp RSI drop to 34.252 (oversold but still falling)\n2. Only $3.40 buffer to stop-loss\n3. Strong bearish momentum in the last candle (-$21.40 drop)\n4. Risk of slippage if stop-loss is hit\n\nIt's prudent to exit now rather than wait for the stop-loss to be triggered. The technical setup has deteriorated significantly, and the risk/reward is no longer favorable.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- **BTC**: Sharp drop from $111,100 to $110,109. RSI crashed from 85 to 44.879. No position, and current volatility suggests waiting.\n- **ETH**: Similar pattern - dropped from $3,950 to $3,890. RSI fell from 81.314 to 45.165. Neutral setup.\n- **SOL**: Dropped from $192.03 to $189.29. RSI plummeted from 83.354 to 38.006. Oversold but no clear entry.\n- **XRP**: Strong performer - up from $2.38 to $2.48. RSI at 87.315 (extremely overbought). Too extended for entry.\n- **DOGE**: Dropped from $0.197240 to $0.194840. RSI at 43.865. No clear setup.\n\nAll major coins showing sharp pullbacks in the latest candle. Market appears to be in a corrective phase.

However, this is extremely close to the threshold with clear downward momentum. The RSI has dropped sharply from 52.248 to 40.717 in one candle, and price action is weakening.\n\nGiven:\n1. RSI(7) is still technically above 40 (40.717)\n2. Price hasn't closed below $188.50\n3. Stop-loss at $189.00 hasn't been hit\n4. Position is only down 1.2%\n\nThe invalidation condition has NOT been met yet, but we're on the edge. I should HOLD for now but monitor closely. If RSI(7) drops below 40 on the next candle, immediate exit would be required.\n\n## Other Opportunities\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Extremely strong momentum: RSI(7) at 98.295 (extremely overbought)\n- Price: $2.60, up from $2.41 (7.9% move in 30 minutes)\n- MACD positive and rising: 0.044\n- Price well above EMA20 ($2.47)\n- Volume: 6,996,131 vs average 5,587,488 (above average)\n\n**Risk Assessment:** RSI(7) at 98.295 is EXTREMELY overbought - this is unsustainable. While momentum is strong, this level of RSI typically precedes sharp corrections. Too risky to enter at these levels.\n\n**BTC, ETH, BNB, DOGE:** No compelling setups. BTC and ETH showing moderate strength but no clear entry points. BNB and DOGE showing weakness with declining RSI.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 40.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 198.5,\n      \"stop_loss\": 189.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $188.50 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 40\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 475.2\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Bearish structure.\n\n**Risk Management:**\nCurrent position uses ~60% of account value with 15x leverage. Sharpe ratio of 6.588 is excellent.

Invalidation condition NOT technically met ($2.61 > $2.54)\n2. Stop-loss NOT hit\n3. RSI showing oversold conditions (potential bounce)\n4. Loss is manageable at -0.84%\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - The specific invalidation condition has not been triggered. Will let stop-loss at $2.54 protect the position if further downside occurs.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, DOGE**: All showing extreme weakness with RSI values between 6-30 (deeply oversold). However:\n- BTC RSI: 16.001 (extreme oversold)\n- ETH RSI: 23.917 (extreme oversold)\n- SOL RSI: 16.824 (extreme oversold)\n- BNB RSI: 15.992 (extreme oversold)\n- DOGE RSI: 6.467 (EXTREMELY oversold - capitulation level)\n\nWhile these are technically oversold and could bounce, the momentum is strongly bearish across all timeframes. With existing XRP position at risk, I will NOT add new positions during this volatile selloff. Risk management dictates waiting for stabilization.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 23000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.79,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.54,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.54 (EMA20 support) on 3-minute candle, indicating trend reversal\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 621.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The position is NOT invalidated. Price is hovering near EMA20 support ($2.63) but hasn't broken down significantly.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n- Price is $0.08 above stop-loss ($2.54), providing adequate buffer\n- No invalidation condition met\n- RSI neutral suggests no extreme conditions\n- Small unrealized loss (-$136) is within acceptable range for position size\n- Recent price action shows consolidation rather than breakdown\n- Volume elevated (8.66M vs avg 7.30M) suggests active market\n\n**Conclusion:** HOLD position. The invalidation condition is clear and has NOT been met. Price remains above critical support levels, and technical indicators show neutral conditions rather than bearish breakdown.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** Severely oversold (RSI 21.45), down to $111,510 from $114,640. MACD deeply negative (-273.78). Price below EMA20. This is a capitulation move, but too risky to catch falling knife with current portfolio exposure.\n\n**ETH:** Also oversold (RSI 19.70), similar pattern to BTC. Down to $3,949.50. Too much downside momentum currently.\n\n**SOL:** RSI 47.84 - most neutral of the group. Price $196.76 vs EMA20 $198.02. Relatively stable but no compelling setup.\n\n**BNB:** Oversold (RSI 24.73), down to $1,098.90. Following broader market weakness.\n\n**DOGE:** Extremely oversold (RSI 20.29), down to $0.191. Weakest performer.\n\n**Risk Management:** With one position at 15x leverage using ~$60K notional (5x account value), I should not add new positions during this market-wide selloff. Better to preserve capital and maintain existing position that hasn't violated its rules.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 23000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.79,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.54,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.54 (EMA20 support) on 3-minute candle, indicating trend reversal\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 621.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Very close to stop-loss with minimal buffer\n2. In a clear downtrend with negative momentum\n3. Part of a broader market selloff\n4. Showing high volume selling pressure\n\nGiven the extreme proximity to the stop-loss and deteriorating market conditions, I should HOLD and let the stop-loss execute if hit, rather than closing prematurely. The RSI oversold reading suggests a potential bounce could occur.

The current price is $2.5488, which is technically above $2.54, BUT:\n1. The EMA20 is now at $2.62, not $2.54 - the support level has moved\n2. Price is trading 2.7% below the current EMA20\n3. The original thesis was EMA20 support - that support has clearly failed\n4. We're dangerously close to stop-loss with extreme bearish momentum\n\n**Decision**: CLOSE POSITION\n- The invalidation condition's spirit (EMA20 support) has been violated\n- Price is within 0.35% of stop-loss with strong downward momentum\n- RSI at extreme oversold levels (16.84) suggests panic selling\n- Risk of hitting stop-loss or liquidation is very high\n- Better to exit now with controlled loss than risk further deterioration\n- Loss of $1,881 is significant but manageable given account size\n\n## Market Overview for Other Coins\n\n### BTC\n- Price: $110,102 | EMA20: $113,027 (2.6% below)\n- RSI(7): 13.152 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 19.760 - deeply oversold\n- MACD: -711.987 - severe bearish momentum\n- Strong downtrend: 114,350 \u2192 110,102 (-3.7%)\n- **Assessment**: Oversold but momentum still bearish. Too risky to catch falling knife.\n\n### ETH\n- Price: $3,902 | EMA20: $4,032 (3.2% below)\n- RSI(7): 13.487 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 20.793 - deeply oversold\n- MACD: -42.487 - strong bearish momentum\n- Downtrend: 4,111 \u2192 3,902 (-5.1%)\n- **Assessment**: Similar to BTC - oversold but dangerous to enter.\n\n### SOL\n- Price: $193.99 | EMA20: $197.29 (1.7% below)\n- RSI(7): 38.638 - approaching oversold but not extreme\n- RSI(14): 39.032 - neutral/slightly oversold\n- MACD: -1.258 - mild bearish\n- Recent bounce visible: 192.75 \u2192 193.99\n- **Assessment**: Most stable of all coins, showing some resilience.\n\n### BNB\n- Price: $1,107.20 | EMA20: $1,121.28 (1.3% below)\n- RSI(7): 41.918 - neutral\n- RSI(14): 39.099 - neutral/slightly oversold\n- MACD: -7.183 - mild bearish\n- Showing stabilization after drop\n- **Assessment**: Relatively stable, but no clear entry signal.\n\n### DOGE\n- Price: $0.19227 | EMA20: $0.19720 (2.5% below)\n- RSI(7): 36.784 - oversold territory\n- RSI(14): 33.962 - oversold\n- MACD: -0.003 - bearish\n- Recent bounce: 0.19098 \u2192 0.19387 \u2192 0.19227\n- **Assessment**: Volatile, oversold but no clear reversal.\n\n## Risk Management Decision\nGiven the severe market-wide selloff (BTC RSI 13.15, ETH RSI 13.49), this appears to be a broad market correction. All major coins are below their EMA20 with negative MACD. The prudent decision is to:\n1. Exit the losing XRP position to preserve capital\n2.

Account value: $10,202.76 with 2.03% total return and a Sharpe ratio of 0.625.\n\nLet me analyze each coin for potential entry opportunities:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $110,833 vs EMA20: $112,948 (trading 1.9% below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 33.78 - oversold territory, recovering from extreme oversold (was 13.0)\n- RSI(14): 30.61 - also oversold\n- MACD: -965.47 - deeply negative but showing signs of bottoming\n- Price action: Sharp decline from $114,640 to $110,102, now bouncing to $110,833\n- Volume: Below average (4,898 vs 6,026)\n- Assessment: Oversold bounce in progress, but still in downtrend. Price below EMA20 and MACD deeply negative. Too risky to enter long here - could be a dead cat bounce.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,933.40 vs EMA20: $4,035.59 (trading 2.5% below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 36.35 - oversold, recovering from 13.09\n- RSI(14): 30.17 - oversold\n- MACD: -61.46 - negative and declining\n- Price action: Dropped from $4,096 to $3,902, slight recovery\n- Volume: Significantly below average (38,851 vs 99,311)\n- Assessment: Similar to BTC - oversold but in downtrend. Low volume suggests weak conviction. Not entering.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $197.17 vs EMA20: $197.45 (trading near EMA, only 0.14% below)\n- RSI(7): 58.85 - neutral to slightly bullish\n- RSI(14): 51.29 - neutral\n- MACD: -1.33 - slightly negative but improving\n- Price action: Dropped to $192.75, now recovering strongly to $197.17\n- Volume: Below average but not drastically (550,277 vs 839,312)\n- Assessment: **BEST SETUP** - Price near EMA20, RSI showing recovery momentum, bouncing off support. This is the cleanest technical setup.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,118.30 vs EMA20: $1,122.59 (0.4% below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 62.01 - bullish momentum\n- RSI(14): 49.78 - neutral\n- MACD: -8.59 - negative but improving\n- Price action: Recovery from $1,098.90 to $1,118.30\n- Assessment: Decent setup but less conviction than SOL. RSI(7) at 62 suggests some upside exhaustion risk.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.58 vs EMA20: $2.62 (1.5% below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 38.98 - oversold recovery\n- RSI(14): 37.98 - oversold\n- MACD: -0.015 - slightly negative\n- Price action: Dropped to $2.55, recovering\n- Assessment: Oversold but weak momentum. Not compelling.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.19368 vs EMA20: $0.19740 (1.9% below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 48.13 - neutral\n- RSI(14): 39.90 - slightly oversold\n- MACD: -0.003 - slightly negative\n- Price action: Volatile, recovering from extreme lows\n- Assessment: Choppy action, no clear setup.\n\n## Trading Decision\n\nI will enter ONE position in **SOL** as it has the best technical setup:\n- Price near EMA20 (key support/resistance level)\n- RSI showing bullish momentum recovery (58.85 on 7-period)\n- Strong bounce from $192.75 support\n- MACD improving\n- Relative strength vs other coins\n\nRisk management:\n- Position size: ~$5,000 (approximately 50% of capital)\n- Leverage: 15x (moderate for this setup)\n- Stop-loss: Below recent low at $192.00 (2.6% below current)\n- Profit target: $205.00 (4.0% above current, near recent resistance)\n- Risk: ~$260 (2.5% of account)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 25.35,\n      \"profit_target\": 205.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 192.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $192.00 on 3-minute candle or if RSI(7) drops below 30 indicating failed bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 260.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price NOT below $192.00 \u2713\n2. RSI(7) at 49.769, NOT below 30 \u2713\n3. Both invalidation conditions are NOT met\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe SOL position is showing resilience. While underwater by $35, the invalidation conditions are NOT triggered:\n- Price is holding $3.87 above the stop-loss level\n- RSI(7) recovered from oversold (was 27.942) to neutral 49.769\n- Recent bounce from $192.75 to $197.17 shows buying support\n- MACD improving (less negative)\n\nThe position is still valid. With 15x leverage, the risk is managed with clear stop-loss at $192.00. The recent RSI recovery from oversold levels and price stabilization above $195 suggests potential for continuation toward the $205 profit target.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Liquidation price: $184.03 (well below current)\n- Stop-loss buffer: $3.87 (2.0%)\n- Position represents ~48.8% of account value\n- Sharpe ratio: 0.625 (acceptable)\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- **BTC**: RSI(7) 47.4, recovering from oversold. Below EMA20 ($111,430 vs $112,864). MACD very negative (-1042). Downtrend still in play.\n- **ETH**: RSI(7) 39.9, weak. Below EMA20 ($3,938 vs $4,032). MACD -69.5. Still bearish.\n- **BNB**: RSI(7) 61.7, showing strength. Near EMA20. MACD improving. Potential but already have SOL exposure.\n- **XRP**: RSI(7) 42.3, neutral. Below EMA20. MACD negative. No clear setup.\n- **DOGE**: RSI(7) 40.2, weak. Below EMA20. MACD negative. No setup.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nHOLD SOL position. Invalidation conditions are not met. The technical setup shows potential for recovery toward profit target. No new positions warranted given current market weakness across most coins.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 25.35,\n      \"profit_target\": 205.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 192.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $192.00 on 3-minute candle or if RSI(7) drops below 30 indicating failed bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 260.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

This presents a potential mean-reversion opportunity. However, I need to be cautious as:\n\n1. All coins are trading below their EMA20 (bearish short-term trend)\n2. MACD is negative across the board (bearish momentum)\n3. Volume is below average (lack of conviction)\n\n**Best Setup: ETH**\n- Most extreme oversold: RSI(7) = 21.8, RSI(14) = 22.9\n- Clear support zone around $3,880\n- High probability of mean reversion bounce toward EMA20 at $4,017\n- Risk/reward favorable with tight stop below recent lows\n\nI will enter a LONG position on ETH targeting a bounce back toward the EMA20, with strict risk management given the bearish momentum.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 13,\n      \"profit_target\": 4020.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3830.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,830 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown of support and continuation of downtrend\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 987.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

ALL assets showing extreme weakness simultaneously (systemic risk)\n2. No reversal confirmation signals\n3. Strong negative momentum (MACD deeply negative, prices below EMAs)\n4. Already negative portfolio performance (-14.18%)\n5. High volume on declines suggests more downside possible\n\n**DECISION: WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION**\n- Do NOT enter positions during free-fall\n- Wait for at least one of: RSI divergence, price reclaiming EMA20, MACD turning positive, or clear reversal candle\n- Preserve capital - better to miss the first 20% of a bounce than catch 100% of continued decline\n- With only 37 minutes of trading and already -14%, risk management is paramount\n\nIf I were forced to pick the best risk/reward, ETH and DOGE show the most extreme oversold readings (RSI 10.29 and 10.70), but the lack of any reversal signal makes this too risky.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

These are historically rare oversold conditions that typically precede sharp mean-reversion bounces. However, the momentum is still strongly bearish with accelerating MACD divergence.\n\n**Risk Assessment**: \n- All coins showing panic selling with volume spikes\n- RSI(7) readings between 6.6 and 11.8 indicate extreme fear\n- Price action is 4.5-8.2% below short-term EMAs\n- MACD still accelerating downward - no bullish divergence yet\n\n**Strategy**: Given the extreme oversold conditions, I will initiate small counter-trend positions in the most oversold assets (ETH and XRP) with tight stop-losses. These are high-risk mean-reversion plays expecting a technical bounce from these extreme levels. I'll use lower leverage (10x) and strict risk management.\n\n**Position Sizing**: Risk $400-500 per trade (4.7-5.8% of capital) with 10x leverage to capture potential bounce while limiting downside.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.35,\n      \"profit_target\": 3850.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3620.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3620 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 5\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 459.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2100.00,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.48,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.32,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.32 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 5\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.60,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Current price is 3803.7, very close to our profit target of 3850. The invalidation condition is NOT met (price above 3620, RSI above 5). However, given:\n1. We're only $46 from profit target (1.2% away)\n2. Overall market remains bearish (below EMA20, negative MACD)\n3. RSI at 43 shows recovery but not strong momentum\n4. We're up 3.1% on this trade with $153 profit\n\n**Decision**: CLOSE POSITION - Take profits. We're within striking distance of our profit target, and the broader market weakness suggests risk of reversal. Lock in the gains.\n\n### XRP Position Analysis\n- **Entry**: 2.383, **Current**: 2.4378 (+2.3%)\n- **Unrealized P&L**: +$112.58\n- **Exit Plan**: Profit target 2.48, Stop-loss 2.32, Invalidation: below 2.32 or RSI(7) < 5\n- **Current RSI(7)**: 32.819 (above 5)\n- **Price vs Stop-loss**: 2.4378 vs 2.32 (buffer of $0.118)\n- **Price vs Profit Target**: 2.4378 vs 2.48 (only $0.042 away - 1.7%)\n\n**Analysis**: XRP has also recovered from extreme oversold conditions (RSI was at 7.7) and is now at 2.4378. The invalidation condition is NOT met (price above 2.32, RSI above 5). However:\n1. We're only $0.042 from profit target (1.7% away)\n2. XRP shows the weakest RSI recovery at 32.8 (most bearish of all coins)\n3. Price remains well below EMA20 (2.56), showing continued bearish pressure\n4. We're up 2.3% with $112 profit\n5. XRP has dropped -7.9% in this period, showing significant weakness\n\n**Decision**: CLOSE POSITION - Take profits. We're very close to our profit target, and XRP shows the weakest technical recovery. The risk/reward doesn't favor holding for an additional 1.7% when we could lose the current 2.3% gain.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC, SOL, BNB, DOGE**: All showing bearish technicals with prices below EMA20, negative MACD, and weak RSI. No compelling entry setups. Market conditions suggest waiting for clearer reversal signals or better risk/reward setups.\n\n## Risk Management Summary\n- Current account value: $8,870.68 (down -11.29%)\n- Closing both positions will lock in ~$266 profit\n- This will improve our overall performance and preserve capital in a weakening market\n- Better to take small wins than risk reversal in bearish conditions\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.35,\n      \"profit_target\": 3850.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3620.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3620 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 5\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 459.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Taking profits - price within 1.2% of profit target (3803.7 vs 3850) with broader market showing bearish structure.

RSI recovering to 51.6 from oversold. MACD still negative (-1,476) but improving slightly. Downtrend showing signs of stabilization but still bearish structure.\n\n**ETH**: Price 3,828 below EMA20 (3,927). RSI at 49.1, neutral zone. MACD negative (-80.7). Similar pattern to BTC - recovering from oversold but still in downtrend.\n\n**SOL**: Price 185.12 below EMA20 (192.16). RSI 40.1, still weak. MACD negative (-3.5). Weakest relative strength among majors.\n\n**BNB**: Price 1,085 below EMA20 (1,105). RSI 46.0, approaching neutral. MACD negative (-13.7). Showing some recovery momentum.\n\n**XRP**: Price 2.47 below EMA20 (2.55). RSI 44.4. MACD negative (-0.047). Consolidating after sharp decline.\n\n**DOGE**: Price 0.1844 below EMA20 (0.1905). RSI 47.2, neutral. MACD negative (-0.004). Slight recovery underway.\n\n**Trading Decision:**\nSince this is the FINAL candle and I have NO open positions, there is nothing to close. I will NOT open any new positions on the final candle as they would need to be immediately closed, which would be pointless and incur unnecessary transaction costs.\n\nThe portfolio is already in the correct state for backtest completion: 100% cash, zero positions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",
