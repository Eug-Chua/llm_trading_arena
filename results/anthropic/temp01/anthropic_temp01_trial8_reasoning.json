This is my second invocation, and I'm down -15.76% from the initial capital, suggesting my previous trade(s) were stopped out or closed at a loss.\n\n### Market-Wide Technical Assessment\n\n**ALL COINS ARE IN SEVERE OVERSOLD TERRITORY:**\n\n1. **BTC**: Price $105,589 vs EMA20 $110,350 (-4.3%)\n   - RSI(7): 17.8 (extreme oversold)\n   - RSI(14): 22.3 (oversold)\n   - MACD: -1,386 (deeply negative, accelerating down)\n   - Price dropped from $111,268 to $105,589 in 30 minutes (-5.1%)\n   - Below both 20 and 50 EMA (bearish structure)\n\n2. **ETH**: Price $3,756 vs EMA20 $3,986 (-5.8%)\n   - RSI(7): 20.6 (extreme oversold)\n   - RSI(14): 25.5 (oversold)\n   - MACD: -68.5 (deeply negative)\n   - Sharp decline from $4,061 to $3,756 (-7.5%)\n\n3. **SOL**: Price $177.65 vs EMA20 $193.22 (-8.1%)\n   - RSI(7): 16.4 (extreme oversold)\n   - RSI(14): 21.5 (oversold)\n   - Dropped from $196.80 to $177.65 (-9.7%)\n\n4. **BNB**: Price $1,062.60 vs EMA20 $1,174.19 (-9.5%)\n   - RSI(7): 9.5 (EXTREMELY oversold - lowest of all)\n   - RSI(14): 14.7 (extreme oversold)\n   - Massive drop from $1,183.80 to $1,062.60 (-10.2%)\n\n5. **XRP**: Price $2.24 vs EMA20 $2.41 (-7.1%)\n   - RSI(7): 17.4 (extreme oversold)\n   - RSI(14): 21.1 (oversold)\n\n6. **DOGE**: Price $0.17849 vs EMA20 $0.19555 (-8.7%)\n   - RSI(7): 14.8 (extreme oversold)\n   - RSI(14): 19.2 (extreme oversold)\n\n### Trading Decision Framework\n\n**This is a capitulation event** - all major cryptos are experiencing synchronized selling pressure with RSI(7) readings between 9.5 and 20.6. This represents extreme fear and potential reversal opportunity.\n\n**Risk Considerations:**\n- Already down 15.76% - need to be cautious about further losses\n- Could be catching a falling knife if this is the start of a larger correction\n- However, RSI levels this extreme historically lead to short-term bounces\n\n**Strategy:**\nI will enter ONE position on the most oversold asset with the best risk/reward setup. BNB shows RSI(7) of 9.5, which is extraordinarily rare and suggests imminent mean reversion. I'll use conservative leverage (10x) and tight risk management.\n\n**Position Sizing:**\n- Available: $8,424.23\n- Risk per trade: 2% of capital = $168.48\n- Will allocate ~$1,500 notional ($150 margin at 10x leverage)\n- Stop-loss: 3% below entry = ~$31.80 distance\n- This limits actual loss to ~$150 if stopped out\n\n### BNB Trade Setup\n\n**Entry Rationale:**\n- RSI(7) at 9.5 is the lowest across all coins - extreme oversold\n- Price $1,062.60 is 9.5% below EMA20\n- MACD at -35 showing maximum bearish momentum (likely exhaustion)\n- Volume is below average, suggesting selling may be exhausting\n- ATR(3) at $59.44 shows high volatility for mean reversion\n\n**Entry**: $1,062.60\n**Stop-Loss**: $1,030 (-3.1% from entry) - below recent low with buffer\n**Profit Target**: $1,125 (+5.9% from entry) - conservative target toward EMA20\n**Leverage**: 10x\n**Position Size**: 1.4 BNB (~$1,488 notional, $148.80 margin)\n**Risk**: $148.80 (1.77% of capital)\n**Invalidation**: If price closes below $1,030 or RSI(7) drops below 8\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.4,\n      \"profit_target\": 1125.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1030.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,030 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 8, indicating continued capitulation\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 148.80\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

RSI(7) at 19.3 (extreme oversold), RSI(14) at 23.5. MACD deeply negative at -1264. Price well below EMA20 (109664). This is capitulation territory.\n\n**ETH**: Down from 3983 to 3777 (-5.2%). RSI(7) at 27.0 (oversold), RSI(14) at 29.9. MACD at -45.7. Price below EMA20 (3943).\n\n**SOL**: Down from 193.71 to 181.47 (-6.3%). RSI(7) at 35.6, RSI(14) at 33.6. MACD at -3.6. Price below EMA20 (190.58).\n\n**BNB**: Down from 1162 to 1071 (-7.8%). RSI(7) at 18.2 (extreme oversold), RSI(14) at 20.9. MACD at -23.8. Price well below EMA20 (1153).\n\n**XRP**: Down from 2.41 to 2.28 (-5.4%). RSI(7) at 35.6, RSI(14) at 33.4. MACD at -0.042.\n\n**DOGE**: Down from 0.196 to 0.183 (-6.6%). RSI(7) at 33.7, RSI(14) at 31.8. MACD at -0.004.\n\n## Position Review: BNB\n\n**Current Position**: 1.4 BNB at entry 1062.6, current price 1071.7\n- **Entry**: 1062.6\n- **Current**: 1071.7 (+0.86%)\n- **Unrealized PnL**: +$12.00\n- **Stop-loss**: 1030.0\n- **Profit target**: 1125.0\n- **Invalidation condition**: \"If price closes below $1,030 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 8\"\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Current price 1071.7 is ABOVE stop-loss of 1030.0 \u2713\n- RSI(7) at 18.2 is ABOVE 8 \u2713\n- However, RSI(7) at 18.2 is extremely oversold (second lowest reading in the series after 9.6)\n- Price has dropped 7.8% in this timeframe and is showing continued weakness\n- MACD at -23.8 and accelerating downward\n- Price is 81 points below EMA20 (1153), showing strong bearish momentum\n- The invalidation condition is technically NOT met (price above 1030, RSI above 8)\n\n**Decision**: This is a critical decision point. While the invalidation condition is not technically met, the market is in severe distress. BNB has the worst RSI(7) reading of all coins at 18.2, indicating extreme selling pressure. The position is barely profitable (+$12) and the risk of further downside is high.\n\nHowever, I must follow my trading rules: the invalidation condition has NOT been met. Price is above 1030 and RSI is above 8. I should HOLD and let my stop-loss do its job if price continues lower.\n\n## New Position Opportunities\n\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions across all assets (BTC RSI 19.3, BNB RSI 18.2, ETH RSI 27.0), this could be a capitulation bottom. However:\n- The trend is clearly down across all timeframes\n- MACD indicators are all deeply negative and worsening\n- Prices are all below their EMA20s\n- Volume is elevated, suggesting panic selling\n\n**Risk Assessment**: With account value at $8,436 (down 15.6%), I have $8,274 cash available. Opening new positions in a falling market is extremely risky. The prudent approach is to wait for signs of stabilization (RSI divergence, MACD turning up, price reclaiming EMA20).\n\n**Conclusion**: HOLD BNB position as invalidation not met. Do NOT open new positions in this falling market.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.4,\n      \"profit_target\": 1125.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1030.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,030 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 8, indicating continued capitulation\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 148.8\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Since invalidation conditions are not met and we have a reasonable stop-loss in place, I'll HOLD and let the position play out according to the exit plan.\n\n## Market Overview for Other Coins:\n\n**BTC:** Severe downtrend, RSI(7) 39.58, MACD -1257.72, price dropped from $111,288 to $106,821. Too risky to enter.\n\n**ETH:** Downtrend, RSI(7) 33.92, MACD -49.57, price fell from $4,012.90 to $3,797.30. Oversold but no clear reversal.\n\n**SOL:** Downtrend, RSI(7) 41.57, MACD -3.88, dropped from $193.49 to $182.74. Showing slight recovery but trend remains down.\n\n**XRP:** Downtrend, RSI(7) 42.80, MACD -0.044, fell from $2.42 to $2.30. Minor recovery signs.\n\n**DOGE:** Downtrend, RSI(7) 42.47, MACD -0.004, dropped from $0.196 to $0.185. Slight recovery.\n\nAll markets are in synchronized downtrend.

The invalidation condition is NOT met:\n- Price is well above $1,030 (currently $1,118)\n- RSI(7) is 69.582, far above the invalidation level of 8\n\nHowever, I'm very close to my profit target. The prudent decision is to HOLD and let it hit the profit target at $1,125, which appears likely given the strong momentum (RSI 69.6, improving MACD, and bullish price action).

Price is approaching the profit target of $1,125, only $22.20 away. However, the recent pullback from $1,118 to $1,102.80 shows some resistance.

Still trading below EMA20 ($1,123.36)\n4. MACD remains negative\n5. RSI showing neutral momentum, not strong bullish continuation\n\n**DECISION: CLOSE POSITION** - Taking profits near resistance. The pullback from $1,118 suggests we may not reach $1,125 easily, and it's prudent to lock in the +$55 profit rather than risk a reversal. The technical setup shows weakening momentum.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE: All showing recovery but still below their EMA20s with negative MACD. Not compelling setups.\n- XRP: Strongest relative strength (RSI 75.4, above EMA20), but already extended.

The stop-loss at $185.50 will protect us if the decline continues.\n\n### Other Coins - New Position Opportunities?\n\n**BTC**: \n- Strong uptrend: $108,591 (up from $106,726)\n- RSI(7): 71.834 - overbought but not extreme\n- MACD: 107.561 - strong positive momentum\n- Price well above EMA20 ($107,617)\n- **Decision**: Attractive but RSI overbought, would need pullback\n\n**ETH**:\n- Very strong: $3,980.40\n- RSI(7): 82.614 - EXTREMELY overbought\n- MACD: 27.512 - strong positive\n- Price significantly above EMA20 ($3,901)\n- **Decision**: Too overbought to enter now\n\n**BNB**:\n- Price: $1,109\n- RSI(7): 56.503 - neutral\n- MACD: -5.908 - still negative\n- Mixed signals, below 50-period EMA\n- **Decision**: No clear setup\n\n**XRP**:\n- Price: $2.39\n- RSI(7): 62.058 - healthy\n- MACD: 0.018 - positive but weak\n- Price above EMA20 ($2.35)\n- **Decision**: Moderate setup but not compelling\n\n**DOGE**:\n- Price: $0.19527\n- RSI(7): 68.474 - approaching overbought\n- MACD: 0.002 - positive\n- Price above EMA20 ($0.190156)\n- **Decision**: Decent momentum but late in move\n\n**Portfolio Consideration**:\n- Current account value: $8,450.27 (down 15.5%)\n- Available cash: $8,062.13\n- Only 1 position (SOL) using ~$4,131 notional\n- Sharpe ratio: -11.457 (very poor)\n\nGiven the poor performance and the fact that my only position is showing weakness, I should NOT add new positions at this time.

RSI(7) is at 70.361 (well above 45) and price is at $191.14 (well above $185.00). The position is profitable (+$49) and approaching the profit target of $195.00. Given the strong momentum, positive MACD, and price above EMA20, I should HOLD this position and let it run toward the profit target. The stop-loss at $185.50 provides adequate downside protection.\n\n## Other Market Opportunities\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Extremely overbought: RSI(7) = 86.833, RSI(14) = 77.681\n- Strong momentum but parabolic move from $106,726 to $110,100\n- MACD very positive (286.793) but risk of pullback high\n- Decision: TOO RISKY to enter at these extreme levels\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Extremely overbought: RSI(7) = 90.328, RSI(14) = 81.205\n- Parabolic rally from $3,876 to $4,025\n- Decision: TOO RISKY - likely near-term top\n\n**XRP, DOGE Analysis:**\n- Both showing RSI(7) > 80 (overbought)\n- Late to the move, poor risk/reward\n- Decision: PASS\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- RSI(7) = 73.779, more reasonable than others\n- MACD still negative (-3.650) but improving\n- Price recovering but below 50-EMA on 4H timeframe\n- Decision: PASS - not compelling enough\n\n## Risk Management\n- Current account value: $8,531.82\n- Available cash: $8,062.13\n- Single position (SOL) with $4,205 notional = 49% of account\n- Position is profitable and has clear exit plan\n- Sharpe ratio negative (-11.457) suggests need for caution\n\n**Conclusion:** HOLD SOL position as invalidation conditions are not met and profit target is within reach.

However, I'm very close to my profit target of $195.00 (only $2.07 away). Given:\n1. RSI(7) at 77.159 shows overbought conditions (though not extreme)\n2. Price momentum is strong but we're approaching resistance\n3. Profit target is within striking distance\n4. No invalidation conditions are met\n5. Risk/reward favors taking profits soon\n\n**DECISION: HOLD** - The invalidation condition is clearly not met, and we're close to profit target. Will let the position run to hit the $195 target or get stopped out at $185.50. The technical setup remains bullish with no reversal signals yet.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** RSI(7) at 91.207 - extremely overbought. Price at $111,161 showing parabolic move. Too risky to enter at these levels.\n\n**ETH:** RSI(7) at 92.913 - extremely overbought, even worse than BTC. Avoid new entries.\n\n**BNB:** RSI(7) at 67.344 - more reasonable but MACD still negative (-2.830). Not compelling.\n\n**XRP:** RSI(7) at 87.651 - very overbought. Strong momentum but late to the party.\n\n**DOGE:** RSI(7) at 86.119 - overbought. Meme coin volatility too high at these levels.\n\n**Conclusion:** All coins showing overbought conditions. No new positions warranted.

Similar to XRP, strong move but risky entry point.\n\n**Portfolio Risk:** Currently down -14.45% overall.

However, already have exposure and cannot pyramid. No position to manage.\n\n**ETH:** Price $3,980.40 pulling back from $4,053.40 high. RSI(7) 40.56 (weak), MACD 51.93 (declining). Showing similar weakness to SOL. Not entering.\n\n**BNB:** Price $1,100.90, RSI(7) 32.17 (oversold), declining from highs. Weak momentum. Not entering.\n\n**XRP:** Price $2.52, RSI(7) 89.38 (extremely overbought), strong rally from $2.35. Too extended for entry. High risk of pullback.\n\n**DOGE:** Price $0.1995, RSI(7) 66.69 (moderate), above EMA20. Decent setup but prefer to close losing position first and reassess.\n\nGiven the portfolio is down -15.26% and the SOL invalidation is triggered, the prudent action is to close SOL and preserve capital. Will not enter new positions at this time given the mixed market conditions and need to stabilize the portfolio.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 22.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 185.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If RSI(7) drops below 45 or price closes below $185.00 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation condition met - RSI(7) at 37.959 has dropped below the 45 threshold, indicating weakening momentum and bearish pressure.

RSI pullback from extreme levels is healthy. Price still above all EMAs with positive MACD. This could be a continuation setup after brief consolidation.\n- **Decision**: ENTER LONG - Good risk/reward after RSI reset, trend remains intact\n\n### ETH (Current: $3,978.10)\n- **Trend**: Uptrend - price above EMA20 ($3,946), MACD positive (43.49)\n- **Momentum**: RSI(7) at 39.3 - sharp drop from 93.8, now oversold\n- **Recent Action**: Peaked at $4,053, pulled back $75 (1.9%)\n- **Assessment**: Severe RSI divergence - dropped from 93.8 to 39.3 very quickly. This suggests momentum exhaustion. Price still above EMA but losing steam. MACD declining. Too risky after such rapid momentum loss.\n- **Decision**: PASS - Wait for clearer setup\n\n### SOL (Current: $189.64)\n- **Trend**: Uptrend - price above EMA20 ($187.99), MACD positive (1.97)\n- **Momentum**: RSI(7) at 47.2 - neutral zone after volatility\n- **Recent Action**: Choppy - peaked at $192.93, now consolidating\n- **Assessment**: Indecisive price action with whipsaw moves. RSI neutral but no clear directional bias. MACD weakening. Not enough conviction for entry.\n- **Decision**: PASS - Unclear setup\n\n### BNB (Current: $1,100.20)\n- **Trend**: At EMA20 ($1,100.54) - critical support test\n- **Momentum**: RSI(7) at 31.4 - oversold territory\n- **Recent Action**: Dropped from $1,127.90 to $1,100.20 (-2.5%)\n- **Assessment**: Testing EMA20 support with oversold RSI. Could bounce, but momentum is weak (MACD declining from 13.08 to 9.21). Volume below average. Risky to catch falling knife.\n- **Decision**: PASS - Wait for confirmation of support hold\n\n### XRP (Current: $2.49)\n- **Trend**: Strong uptrend - price well above EMA20 ($2.41), MACD positive (0.046)\n- **Momentum**: RSI(7) at 66.1 - healthy bullish zone after spike to 89.4\n- **Recent Action**: Spiked to $2.52, slight pullback but holding gains\n- **Assessment**: Excellent setup - strong uptrend, RSI cooled from extreme but still bullish, MACD accelerating. Price above all EMAs with good momentum. Volume healthy.\n- **Decision**: ENTER LONG - Strong trend with healthy pullback, good R/R\n\n### DOGE (Current: $0.19995)\n- **Trend**: Strong uptrend - price well above EMA20 ($0.19423), MACD positive (0.004)\n- **Momentum**: RSI(7) at 70.0 - at overbought threshold\n- **Recent Action**: Rallied from $0.193 to $0.201, now consolidating\n- **Assessment**: Strong trend but RSI at 70 is concerning. Already extended. MACD positive but could be topping. Better to wait for pullback.\n- **Decision**: PASS - Too extended, wait for better entry\n\n## Risk Management Strategy\nGiven -15.28% drawdown, I need to be conservative:\n- Risk 2% per trade ($169 per position)\n- Focus on strongest setups only (BTC and XRP)\n- Use tight stops to preserve capital\n- Target 2:1 reward/risk minimum\n\n## Selected Trades\n\n**BTC LONG**: \n- Entry: $110,479\n- Stop: $108,500 (below recent consolidation and EMA20)\n- Target: $114,500 (previous resistance area)\n- Risk: ~$1,979 per contract, using 15x leverage = 0.012 BTC = $169 risk\n- Invalidation: Price closes below $108,500 (breaks EMA20 support)\n\n**XRP LONG**:\n- Entry: $2.49\n- Stop: $2.38 (below EMA20 and recent consolidation)\n- Target: $2.71 (extension of current move)\n- Risk: ~$0.11 per unit, need ~1,536 XRP = $169 risk at 15x leverage\n- Invalidation: Price closes below $2.38 (breaks uptrend structure)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.012,\n      \"profit_target\": 114500.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 108500.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $108,500 on 3-minute candle, breaking EMA20 support and invalidating uptrend structure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 169.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1536,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.71,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.38,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.38 on 3-minute candle, breaking EMA20 support and uptrend structure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 169.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

This is a broad market correction, not isolated to XRP. Given the extreme oversold readings across all assets, this could present buying opportunities, but with current drawdown of -16.74% and limited capital ($8,183.75), risk management dictates caution.\n\n**Portfolio Decision**: Maintain XRP position as invalidation not triggered.

Current price is $2.4301, which is ABOVE $2.38. However, we're dangerously close (only 2% buffer). The price has been declining and is below EMA20, showing weakness in the uptrend structure mentioned in the invalidation condition.\n\n**Decision Rationale**: \n- The position is underwater by $99\n- We're very close to stop-loss ($2.38)\n- Price is below EMA20, suggesting weakening uptrend\n- RSI shows oversold conditions which could mean a bounce\n- However, the trend is clearly weakening\n\nGiven we're only $0.05 away from stop-loss and the uptrend structure is weakening (price below EMA20), I should **CLOSE** this position for risk management.

Severe oversold conditions but in strong downtrend. Below EMA20 ($3,943). Too risky to enter during panic selling.\n\n**SOL**: Price $186.17, RSI(7) = 37.1 (oversold), below EMA20 ($187.90). Showing weakness. Not entering.\n\n**BNB**: Price $1,076, RSI(7) = 23.9 (very oversold), RSI(14) = 30.2. Below EMA20 ($1,101). Oversold but in downtrend. Not entering.\n\n**DOGE**: Price $0.1944, RSI(7) = 26.4 (oversold), near EMA20 ($0.1948). Weak momentum. Not entering.\n\n**Overall Market Assessment**: All coins showing oversold conditions with RSI(7) between 14-38, suggesting a market-wide selloff. This is a risk-off environment.

This is a coordinated market-wide pump, likely driven by external news or large institutional flow.\n\n**Trading Psychology**: After a -16.62% drawdown, the temptation is to chase this rally to recover losses. However:\n1. Entering at the top of a parabolic move is extremely dangerous\n2. RSI overbought across all assets\n3. High probability of immediate pullback/consolidation\n4. Better to wait for a healthy retracement to enter\n\n**Optimal Strategy**: \n- Preserve capital ($8,338)\n- Wait for pullback to support levels\n- Look for entries on retest of EMA20 or previous resistance-turned-support\n- Avoid FOMO-driven entries at local tops\n\n## Final Decision\n**NO TRADES** - All assets are extended after parabolic moves. The risk/reward is unfavorable at current levels. Better to wait for consolidation or pullback to enter with better risk management.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

While the technical picture is bearish (below EMA, negative MACD), the position is:\n1. Not at stop-loss ($3,780)\n2. Above invalidation level ($3,750)\n3. Showing small profit\n4. RSI oversold suggests potential bounce\n\nHowever, the momentum is clearly bearish. Price is struggling below EMA20, MACD is deteriorating, and we're in a downtrend. The position is barely profitable and at risk.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nGiven the weak technicals and bearish momentum, I should consider tightening the stop or taking the small profit. But since the invalidation condition explicitly states \"below $3,750\" and we're at $3,839, the rules say to hold unless that condition is met.\n\n**Final Decision: HOLD** - Invalidation condition not met, stop-loss not hit, but monitoring closely for any break below $3,750.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC, SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE: No positions, not entering new trades given overall market weakness and negative momentum across the board.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.39,\n      \"profit_target\": 3950.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3780.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,750 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown of support\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 100.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price is declining and very close to stop-loss ($22.30 away)\n2. Strong bearish momentum (MACD -39.073, declining)\n3. Oversold RSI could indicate bounce potential, BUT...\n4. The broader market shows weakness across all coins\n5. With 15x leverage, a small adverse move could trigger stop-loss\n6. However, invalidation condition has NOT been met yet ($3,802 > $3,750)\n\nGiven that:\n- The invalidation condition is NOT met\n- The stop-loss has NOT been hit yet\n- RSI is deeply oversold (potential for bounce)\n- I should follow my exit plan systematically\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - The invalidation condition has not been triggered. The stop-loss at $3,780 will protect against further downside. If price continues down another $22, the stop-loss will automatically close the position.\n\n## Market Overview for Other Coins\n\n**BTC:** $107,840 - RSI 38.4, MACD -196.9, below EMA20. Bearish trend.\n**SOL:** $180.17 - RSI 17.5 (extremely oversold), MACD -1.8. Severe weakness.\n**BNB:** $1,068.90 - RSI 41.5, MACD -12.2.

Price is trending down consistently\n2. RSI shows extreme oversold conditions (26.2), which could indicate a bounce\n3. MACD is deeply negative and worsening\n4. Stop-loss is only $23.60 away\n5. Invalidation condition has NOT been met yet ($3,803.60 > $3,750.00)\n\nHowever, the technical picture is deteriorating rapidly. The price is:\n- Below EMA20 by $103.56\n- In a clear downtrend\n- Approaching stop-loss dangerously close\n\n**Risk Management Consideration:**\nGiven the proximity to stop-loss ($23.60 away) and the strong bearish momentum, I should consider closing this position proactively rather than waiting for the stop-loss to be hit. The RSI oversold condition could provide a bounce, but the overall trend is clearly bearish.\n\n**DECISION: CLOSE POSITION**\nReason: Price is dangerously close to stop-loss ($23.60 away), strong bearish momentum with MACD at -44.239, and trading $103.56 below EMA20. While invalidation condition hasn't been technically met, risk management dictates closing before stop-loss is hit to preserve capital. The position is down only $10.11, which is manageable compared to potential further losses.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC, SOL, XRP, DOGE: All showing oversold RSI conditions (34.6, 17.1, 18.9, 25.3) but strong bearish momentum\n- BNB: RSI 44.5, less oversold but still below EMA\n- Market-wide weakness suggests waiting for clearer reversal signals before entering new positions\n- With account down -25.06%, capital preservation is priority\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.39,\n      \"profit_target\": 3950.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3780.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,750 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 100.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - price dangerously close to stop-loss ($23.60 away), strong bearish momentum with MACD at -44.239, trading $103.56 below EMA20.

RSI(14) drops below 50 **AND** bearish MACD crossover - **PARTIALLY MET**\n   - RSI(14) at 47.732 is below 50 \u2713\n   - MACD is still positive (11.902) but declining - no bearish crossover yet \u2717\n\n**Critical Assessment**:\nWhile the full invalidation condition isn't technically met (MACD hasn't crossed bearish yet), the position is showing significant weakness:\n- RSI(14) below 50 and RSI(7) at extreme oversold (34.252)\n- Sharp price rejection from highs\n- MACD momentum declining rapidly\n- Price dangerously close to stop-loss ($1,085 is only $18.40 away)\n- Already down 2.36% with 15x leverage risk\n\n**Decision**: **CLOSE POSITION** - The spirit of the invalidation condition is being met. RSI(14) has dropped below 50, momentum is clearly bearish, and waiting for a full MACD crossover could result in hitting the stop-loss.

If next candle closes below $188.50, immediate exit required.\n\n## Other Opportunities\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Explosive move: $2.41 \u2192 $2.60 (+7.9% in 30 minutes)\n- RSI (7-period): 98.295 \u2192 EXTREMELY overbought\n- RSI (14-period): 93.376 \u2192 EXTREMELY overbought\n- MACD: 0.044 and accelerating\n- Price above EMA20: $2.60 vs $2.47 (+5.3%)\n\nThis is a parabolic move with RSI at 98.295 - highest possible overbought reading. This is NOT a buy opportunity; it's a blow-off top signal. High risk of sharp reversal.\n\n**BTC, ETH, BNB, DOGE:**\n- All showing mixed signals\n- No clear high-probability setups\n- Better to focus on managing existing SOL position\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 38.9,\n      \"profit_target\": 202.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 188.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $188.50 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown below EMA20 support and recent swing low\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The invalidation condition has NOT been triggered - price has stayed above $188.50 throughout and remains above the rising EMA20 ($190.24). The recent pullback from $194.42 to $193.76 is minor consolidation, not a breakdown. RSI at 59.5 shows room for upside without being overbought. MACD remains positive.

Current price is $192.91, which is $4.41 above the invalidation level. The position is NOT invalidated.\n\nHowever, I'm observing concerning signals:\n1.

We're not getting the follow-through we expected, and protecting capital in a -23.44% drawdown situation is paramount.\n\n**Other Coins Assessment:**\n- **BTC**: RSI dropped to 44.918 (oversold territory), but MACD still positive. Price above EMA20. No position.\n- **ETH**: RSI 43.967 (oversold), price above EMA20. Weak momentum. No position.\n- **BNB**: RSI 58.942 (neutral), price above EMA20, MACD declining.

RSI bounced from oversold territory (30.19) to 42.96, suggesting selling pressure is easing. Price remains above EMA20 support and well above the stop-loss. MACD is still positive despite declining. The invalidation condition has not been triggered.\n\nHowever, I'm concerned about:\n1. The sharp rejection from $115,566 showing strong resistance\n2. Declining MACD momentum\n3. Overall portfolio is down -21.25% with poor Sharpe ratio\n4. Position is barely profitable and momentum is weakening\n\nGiven the weak momentum, declining MACD, and the fact that we're only up $27.73 on a $15,070 position (0.18% gain on 15x leverage is minimal), I should consider taking profits or at least protecting capital. The recent volatility (drop from $115,566 to $113,903) suggests this could reverse quickly.\n\n**DECISION: CLOSE POSITION** - Taking profits while we have them. The momentum is weakening, MACD declining, and we've seen strong rejection at higher levels. Better to lock in small gains than risk reversal given poor overall portfolio performance.\n\n## Other Coins Analysis\n\n**ETH:** No position. Price at $4,116.30, above EMA20 ($4,076.33). RSI recovering from oversold (31.93 to 43.88). Similar pattern to BTC - sharp drop and recovery. Not entering due to weakening momentum.\n\n**SOL:** No position. Price at $202.32, above EMA20 ($198.45). RSI at 69.21 (approaching overbought). Showing relative strength but not entering new positions given portfolio drawdown.\n\n**BNB:** No position. Price at $1,131.40, below EMA20 ($1,134.84). RSI at 32.45 (oversold). Bearish - price declining and below EMA support.\n\n**XRP:** No position. Price at $2.64, above EMA20 ($2.62). RSI at 49.40 (neutral). Consolidating but no clear setup.\n\n**DOGE:** No position. Price at $0.200230, below EMA20 ($0.200836). RSI at 34.16 (oversold). Weak momentum.\n\nGiven the poor portfolio performance (-21.25% return, -7.61 Sharpe), I should focus on capital preservation rather than opening new positions in uncertain market conditions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.132,\n      \"profit_target\": 116500.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 112500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $112,500 on 3-minute candle, breaking EMA20 support and confirming downtrend continuation\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1500.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Taking profits while available - MACD momentum declining from peak (1076.39 to 855.83), recent sharp rejection from $115,566 shows strong resistance, and minimal gain (+$27.73) on high leverage position suggests risk/reward no longer favorable.

The market shows:\n1. Most coins losing momentum after overbought conditions\n2. Below-average volume across the board (lack of conviction)\n3. Mixed signals - some bullish structure but fading momentum\n\n**Best Opportunity: BTC**\n- Strongest relative strength with price above all key EMAs\n- RSI recovered to neutral (50.93) from oversold - healthy reset\n- MACD still positive at 726.87\n- 20 EMA > 50 EMA (bullish longer-term structure)\n- Current pullback to $114,350 from $115,566 high offers entry\n- Risk: Volume is low, momentum declining\n\nI'll take a small, conservative position in BTC with tight risk management:\n- Entry: $114,350\n- Stop-loss: $113,000 (below recent low and EMA support)\n- Profit target: $117,000 (2.3% move, reasonable given volatility)\n- Risk: ~$135 per 0.01 BTC = $1,350 total risk (17% of capital)\n- Leverage: 10x for position sizing\n- Invalidation: If price closes below $113,000 (breaks support structure)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.10,\n      \"profit_target\": 117000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 113000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $113,000 on 3-minute candle, breaking below EMA20 support and recent swing low\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1350.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

This is a capitulation-style move with prices breaking below EMAs and MACD turning negative or declining sharply.\n\n## Position Review: ETH\n\n**Current Status**:\n- Entry: $3,978.00, Current: $3,996.90 (+$18.85 per unit)\n- Unrealized P&L: +$19.11 (small profit)\n- Position size: 1.13 ETH at 15x leverage\n- Profit target: $4,072.00\n- Stop-loss: $3,920.00\n- Invalidation condition: \"If price closes below $3,900 on 3-minute candle\"\n\n**Technical Analysis**:\n- Current price: $3,996.90\n- RSI (7-period): 23.917 - deeply oversold\n- RSI (14-period): 32.530 - oversold\n- MACD: 11.476 (declining rapidly from 59.332)\n- Price below EMA20 ($4,064.38)\n- Recent price action: Sharp drop from $4,173.90 to $3,978.00, now bouncing slightly to $3,996.90\n\n**Invalidation Check**:\n- Invalidation level: $3,900\n- Current price: $3,996.90\n- Distance from invalidation: $96.90 (2.4%)\n- Recent low: $3,978.00 (just $78 above invalidation)\n\n**Critical Assessment**: \nThe position is dangerously close to its invalidation condition. While we haven't technically closed below $3,900 yet, the price came within $78 of that level and is showing extreme weakness. The RSI at 23.9 indicates oversold conditions, but in a strong downtrend, oversold can stay oversold. The MACD is collapsing, and we're well below the EMA20.\n\nHowever, the invalidation condition specifically states \"closes below $3,900 on 3-minute candle\" - and we haven't hit that yet. Current price is $3,996.90, which is $96.90 above the invalidation level.\n\n**Risk Assessment**:\n- We're in small profit (+$19)\n- Stop-loss at $3,920 is only $76.90 away\n- Liquidation at $3,712.80 gives us some buffer\n- Market showing extreme selling pressure\n\n**Decision**: CLOSE POSITION\n**Reasoning**: While the invalidation condition hasn't technically been met, we are:\n1. In a severe downtrend with collapsing momentum\n2. Only $76.90 from stop-loss\n3. Price came within $78 of invalidation level\n4. RSI showing extreme oversold but in strong downtrend\n5. We have a small profit to protect (+$19)\n\nGiven the extreme market weakness and proximity to both stop-loss and invalidation, the prudent risk management decision is to close and preserve capital. The market is showing capitulation characteristics, and holding through this volatility with 15x leverage is unnecessarily risky when we're barely in profit.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC, SOL, BNB, DOGE, XRP**: All showing extreme oversold conditions (RSI 6-16 range). While these could represent buying opportunities at a market bottom, the momentum is still strongly negative with MACD declining/negative, prices below EMAs, and no signs of reversal. Given our current drawdown (-21.99%) and the need for capital preservation, I will not enter new positions in this volatile environment.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.13,\n      \"profit_target\": 4072.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3920.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,900 on 3-minute candle, indicating support breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 300.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - price within $77 of stop-loss and $97 of invalidation level during severe market selloff.

The recent bounce to $198.84 was rejected, and we're now at $196.76. The market is showing weakness across all major coins (BTC RSI 21.4, ETH RSI 19.7, DOGE RSI 20.3).

The RSI(7) briefly recovered above 25 but failed to hold, and has now deteriorated to extreme oversold levels (13.487). The strong downtrend with MACD at -42.487 and price 130 points below EMA20 suggests continued weakness.\n\nHowever, there's a counterargument: ETH is at extreme oversold levels (RSI 13.487), which often precedes a bounce. The position is essentially flat (-$0.65), and we're still $27 away from the stop-loss.\n\n**Risk Management Consideration:**\nGiven the invalidation condition has technically been met (RSI failed to sustain above 25), and the technical picture shows accelerating bearish momentum, the prudent decision is to close the position. The account is already down -40.81%, and preserving capital is paramount.\n\n## Market Overview for Other Coins\n\n**BTC:** RSI(7) 13.152 - Extreme oversold, down from $114,350 to $110,102 (-3.7%)\n**SOL:** RSI(7) 38.638 - Showing some resilience, relatively stable\n**BNB:** RSI(7) 41.918 - Holding better than BTC/ETH\n**XRP:** RSI(7) 16.840 - Extreme oversold, sharp decline\n**DOGE:** RSI(7) 36.784 - Moderate weakness\n\nAll major coins are showing weakness, but BTC, ETH, and XRP are in extreme oversold territory. Given the portfolio is down -40.81%, I should not be adding new positions in this volatile environment. The focus should be on capital preservation.\n\n**Final Decision:** Close ETH position due to invalidation condition being met (RSI failed to recover and sustain above 25, now at extreme oversold 13.487 with accelerating bearish momentum).\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.2,\n      \"profit_target\": 4050.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3875.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,875 on 3-minute candle or if RSI(7) fails to recover above 25 within next 3 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 85.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation condition met - RSI(7) failed to sustain recovery above 25 and has deteriorated to extreme oversold levels (13.487) with accelerating bearish momentum (MACD -42.487).

Risk management is paramount - I've lost 41.84% and cannot afford another large loss\n2. All major coins are oversold, suggesting potential bounce opportunity\n3. BNB shows relative strength with neutral RSI and improving MACD\n4. Volume is below average across all coins, suggesting weak conviction\n5. Need tight stop-losses given the downtrend context\n\n**Strategy:** I will take ONE small position in BNB due to its relative strength and neutral RSI, suggesting it may lead any bounce.

However, given:\n\n1. **My poor performance (-41.94%)** - I need to be extremely cautious\n2. **No clear reversal signals yet** - All MACDs still declining, no bullish divergence\n3. **Downtrend momentum is strong** - All prices below EMA20 and falling\n4. **Risk of catching a falling knife** - The selloff could continue\n\n**DECISION: WAIT FOR STABILIZATION**\n\nWhile these are oversold levels that typically precede bounces, I have no confirmation of a reversal. The smart play is to wait for:\n- RSI to start rising from these extreme levels\n- Price to stabilize or show a higher low\n- MACD to show bullish divergence\n- At least one 3-minute candle to close higher\n\nGiven my significant drawdown, I cannot afford to catch a falling knife.

RSI(7) below 12 (extreme oversold - typically bounces from these levels)\n2. RSI(14) below 20 (extreme oversold territory)\n3. High volume selloffs (panic selling)\n4. Prices far below EMAs\n5. Accelerating negative MACD\n\n**Strategy**: These are historically extreme oversold conditions that often lead to sharp bounces. However, given:\n- My poor performance (-41.94%)\n- The severity of the downtrend (all indicators bearish)\n- Risk of further capitulation before bounce\n- Need for confirmation of reversal\n\nI will take a CALCULATED CONTRARIAN POSITION on the most oversold coins with the best risk/reward setup. ETH and XRP show the most extreme RSI readings (6.60 and 7.73), suggesting imminent bounce potential.\n\n**Risk Management**:\n- Use tight stop-losses (2-3% below current prices)\n- Small position sizes (risk ~$500-600 per trade)\n- Target quick 5-8% bounces\n- Leverage: 15x for quick scalp opportunities\n- Total risk: ~$1,200 (20% of capital)\n\n## Position Plans\n\n**ETH**: RSI(7) at 6.60 is critically oversold - historically these levels see bounces\n- Entry: 3,688\n- Stop-loss: 3,580 (3% below, protects against further capitulation)\n- Profit target: 3,940 (6.8% gain, back toward EMA20)\n- Invalidation: If price breaks below 3,550 (new lows)\n- Risk: $600\n\n**XRP**: RSI(7) at 7.73 is critically oversold, second-most extreme\n- Entry: 2.38\n- Stop-loss: 2.31 (3% below)\n- Profit target: 2.54 (6.7% gain, back toward EMA20)\n- Invalidation: If price breaks below 2.28 (new lows)\n- Risk: $600\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 3940.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3580.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3550 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued capitulation\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 600.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1680.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.54,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.31,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.28 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued capitulation\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.60,\n      \"risk_usd\": 600.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "# CHAIN OF THOUGHT\n\n## Current Market Analysis\nThe market is experiencing significant downward pressure across all assets:\n- **BTC**: Down from 113134 to 108360 (-4.2%), RSI at 41.2, deeply negative MACD (-1681), price well below EMA20\n- **ETH**: Down from 4008 to 3803 (-5.1%), RSI at 43.4, negative MACD (-96.6), below EMA20\n- **SOL**: Down from 198.84 to 184.62 (-7.2%), RSI at 37.9, negative MACD (-3.6)\n- **XRP**: Down from 2.65 to 2.44 (-7.9%), RSI at 32.8, negative MACD (-0.052)\n- All assets showing bearish momentum with prices below their 20-period EMAs\n\n## Position Review\n\n### ETH Position Analysis\n- **Entry**: 3688.0, **Current**: 3803.7 (+3.1%, +$125.24 unrealized PnL)\n- **Stop-loss**: 3580, **Profit target**: 3940\n- **Invalidation condition**: \"If price closes below 3550 on 3-minute candle\"\n- **Status Check**: \n  - Current price 3803.7 is ABOVE invalidation level (3550) \u2713\n  - Current price is ABOVE stop-loss (3580) \u2713\n  - Price bounced from 3688 low to 3803.7, showing +3.1% gain\n  - RSI at 43.4 (recovering from oversold 6.6)\n  - However, still below profit target (3940)\n  \n**Decision**: **CLOSE POSITION** - While invalidation not technically met, the broader market is showing severe weakness. ETH dropped to 3688 (extreme oversold RSI 6.6) and bounced to 3803. This represents a good exit point to lock in +$125 profit (+3.1%) before potential further downside. The bounce appears corrective rather than reversal, with price still well below EMA20 (3949) and MACD deeply negative.\n\n### XRP Position Analysis\n- **Entry**: 2.383, **Current**: 2.4378 (+2.3%, +$90.06 unrealized PnL)\n- **Stop-loss**: 2.31, **Profit target**: 2.54\n- **Invalidation condition**: \"If price closes below 2.28 on 3-minute candle\"\n- **Status Check**:\n  - Current price 2.4378 is ABOVE invalidation level (2.28) \u2713\n  - Current price is ABOVE stop-loss (2.31) \u2713\n  - Price bounced from 2.38 low to 2.44, showing +2.3% gain\n  - RSI at 32.8 (recovering from extreme oversold 7.7)\n  - XRP showed the steepest decline (-7.9%) but also bouncing\n\n**Decision**: **CLOSE POSITION** - Similar reasoning to ETH. XRP has recovered +2.3% from entry, providing a good exit opportunity. The extreme volatility (dropped to RSI 7.7) and continued negative MACD suggest this is a corrective bounce in a downtrend. With the broader market showing weakness and XRP being one of the most volatile assets in this decline, it's prudent to take the +$90 profit and preserve capital.\n\n## Risk Management Rationale\n- Portfolio down -39.68% overall - need to preserve remaining capital\n- Both positions showing small profits in a strongly bearish market\n- Taking profits now protects against potential further downside\n- Market structure remains bearish (all assets below EMA20, negative MACD)\n- The bounces appear corrective rather than trend reversals\n- Better to lock in gains and wait for clearer market direction\n\n## New Position Opportunities\nGiven the severe market weakness and bearish technical structure across all assets, I will NOT open any new positions. The market needs to stabilize and show clearer reversal signals before deploying capital.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 3940.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3580.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3550 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued capitulation\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 600.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Taking profits at +3.1% during corrective bounce in broader bearish market.
