I need to analyze the market conditions for all coins and identify potential entry opportunities.\n\n## Market Analysis by Coin:\n\n**BTC (Current: $109,160)**\n- Price well below EMA20 ($111,104), indicating downtrend\n- MACD deeply negative (-1429), showing strong bearish momentum\n- RSI(7) at 43.9 - recovering from oversold but still weak\n- Recent price action: Sharp drop from $111,268 to $108,211, now bouncing to $109,160\n- Volume significantly below average (3,548 vs 7,856)\n- Assessment: In downtrend but showing signs of bottoming. RSI was at 20.8 and now recovering to 43.9. Potential bounce play but risky.\n\n**ETH (Current: $3,930.90)**\n- Price below EMA20 ($4,023), bearish structure\n- MACD negative (-71.78), bearish momentum\n- RSI(7) at 45.5 - recovering from 21.4 oversold level\n- Recent drop from $4,061 to $3,864, now recovering\n- Volume very low (52,185 vs 135,853)\n- Assessment: Similar to BTC - oversold bounce potential but still in downtrend\n\n**SOL (Current: $186.91)**\n- Price significantly below EMA20 ($195.30)\n- MACD negative (-5.06), bearish\n- RSI(7) at 35.6 - recovering from 19.0 extreme oversold\n- Sharp drop from $196.80 to $184.76, now bouncing\n- Volume low (464,414 vs 1,197,511)\n- Assessment: Oversold but weak structure\n\n**BNB (Current: $1,149.30)**\n- Price well below EMA20 ($1,188)\n- MACD negative (-31.54)\n- RSI(7) at 37.8 - recovering from 13.5 extreme oversold\n- Dropped from $1,183 to $1,134, now recovering\n- Very low volume (4,336 vs 19,293)\n- Assessment: Oversold bounce potential but very weak volume\n\n**XRP (Current: $2.36)**\n- Price below EMA20 ($2.44)\n- MACD negative (-0.058)\n- RSI(7) at 41.5 - recovering from 20.2 oversold\n- Volume above average (13.08M vs 10.32M) - NOTABLE\n- Assessment: Showing relative strength with above-average volume\n\n**DOGE (Current: $0.19023)**\n- Price below EMA20 ($0.19826)\n- MACD negative (-0.005)\n- RSI(7) at 37.3 - recovering from 18.5 oversold\n- Volume very low (16.19M vs 67.55M)\n- Assessment: Weak structure, low volume\n\n## Trading Decision:\n\nAll coins are in downtrends but showing oversold bounces. This is a risky environment for initial positions. However, I see potential in **XRP** due to:\n1. Above-average volume (bullish divergence)\n2. RSI recovering from extreme oversold (20.2 \u2192 41.5)\n3. Smallest percentage distance from EMA20 (showing relative strength)\n4. Recent bounce from $2.33 to $2.36\n\nI'll take a conservative position in XRP with tight risk management, risking only 5% of capital ($500).\n\n**Entry Strategy for XRP:**\n- Entry: $2.36\n- Stop-loss: $2.30 (below recent low of $2.33, -2.5%)\n- Profit target: $2.48 (near EMA20 resistance, +5.1%)\n- Risk/Reward: 1:2 ratio\n- Leverage: 15x to maximize position while controlling risk\n- Position size: With 15x leverage and $500 risk, I can control ~$7,500 notional\n- Quantity: $7,500 / $2.36 = ~3,178 XRP\n- Invalidation: If price closes below $2.30 or RSI(7) drops back below 25\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 3178,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.48,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.30,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.30 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 25 indicating failed bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

This appears to be a flash crash or major liquidation event:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $105,589 (down from $111,268 in 30 minutes = -5.1%)\n- RSI(7): 17.8 - Extremely oversold (below 20)\n- RSI(14): 22.3 - Deeply oversold\n- MACD: -1386.48 - Strongly negative and accelerating downward\n- Price well below EMA20 ($110,350) - strong downtrend\n- Volume elevated (9,740 vs avg 8,197)\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,756 (down from $4,061 = -7.5%)\n- RSI(7): 20.6 - Extremely oversold\n- RSI(14): 25.5 - Oversold\n- MACD: -68.5 - Strongly negative\n- Price below EMA20 ($3,986) by 5.8%\n- Volume spike (213,882 vs avg 142,519)\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $177.65 (down from $196.80 = -9.7%)\n- RSI(7): 16.4 - Most oversold of all coins\n- RSI(14): 21.5 - Deeply oversold\n- MACD: -5.3 - Negative and declining\n- Price below EMA20 ($193.22) by 8.1%\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,062.60 (down from $1,183.80 = -10.2%)\n- RSI(7): 9.5 - CRITICALLY oversold (lowest reading)\n- RSI(14): 14.7 - Extremely oversold\n- MACD: -35.0 - Strongly negative\n- Price below EMA20 ($1,174) by 9.5%\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.24 (down from $2.45 = -8.6%)\n- RSI(7): 17.4 - Extremely oversold\n- RSI(14): 21.1 - Oversold\n- MACD: -0.059 - Negative\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.17849 (down from $0.20026 = -10.9%)\n- RSI(7): 14.8 - Extremely oversold\n- RSI(14): 19.2 - Deeply oversold\n- MACD: -0.005 - Negative\n\n## Trading Decision Rationale\n\n**Current Status:** No open positions, $9,605.68 available cash\n\n**Market Condition:** This is a panic selloff with ALL coins showing:\n1. RSI(7) below 20 (extreme oversold)\n2. RSI(14) below 30 (oversold)\n3. Negative MACD momentum\n4. Prices significantly below EMA20\n5. Elevated volume on the decline\n\n**Strategy:** This presents a potential mean-reversion opportunity. When RSI(7) drops below 20 across multiple assets simultaneously, it often signals capitulation and potential bounce. However, the risk is that this could be the start of a larger crash.\n\n**Risk Management Approach:**\n- Enter small positions with tight stop-losses\n- Focus on coins with most extreme oversold readings (BNB RSI 9.5, DOGE 14.8, SOL 16.4)\n- Use 15x leverage for better risk/reward on mean reversion\n- Risk $500-600 per position (5-6% of capital per trade)\n- Set profit targets at recent support/EMA levels\n- Invalidation if price continues below recent lows\n\n**Position Selection:**\n1. **BNB** - RSI(7) at 9.5 is historically extreme, highest probability of bounce\n2. **DOGE** - RSI(7) at 14.8, strong oversold signal\n3. **SOL** - RSI(7) at 16.4, good risk/reward\n\nI'll skip BTC, ETH, and XRP to maintain diversification and focus on the most extreme oversold conditions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.085,\n      \"profit_target\": 1120.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1040.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,040 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 550.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 33500,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.188000,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.173000,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $0.173 on 3-minute candle, breaking recent low\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 550.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 17.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 186.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 172.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $172 on 3-minute candle, confirming further downside\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.70,\n      \"risk_usd\": 525.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Current price at $1,071.70 is still above the stop-loss. However, the position is barely profitable (+$0.73) and the market is in a strong downtrend. The invalidation condition has NOT been met yet.\n\n**Decision**: HOLD - Invalidation condition not met, though monitoring closely.\n\n### DOGE Position\n- Entry: $0.17849, Current: $0.18261 (+2.31%)\n- Unrealized P&L: +$135.03\n- Stop-loss: $0.173, Profit target: $0.188\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below $0.173 on 3-minute candle\"\n- Current RSI(7): 33.7 (oversold)\n- Price is $0.00961 above stop-loss\n\n**Analysis**: DOGE is performing well with +$135 profit. Current price $0.18261 is well above the invalidation level of $0.173. The position is showing resilience in this selloff. Price is approaching profit target of $0.188 (only $0.00539 away). RSI showing oversold but recovering.\n\n**Decision**: HOLD - Strong performance, invalidation not met, approaching profit target.\n\n### SOL Position\n- Entry: $177.65, Current: $181.47 (+2.15%)\n- Unrealized P&L: +$65.30\n- Stop-loss: $172, Profit target: $186\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below $172 on 3-minute candle\"\n- Current RSI(7): 35.6 (oversold)\n- Price is $9.47 above stop-loss\n\n**Analysis**: SOL showing good profit of +$65.30. Current price $181.47 is well above the invalidation level of $172. Price is $4.53 away from profit target of $186. The position has room to run and invalidation condition is not met.\n\n**Decision**: HOLD - Good profit, invalidation not met, reasonable distance to profit target.\n\n## Risk Management Assessment\n- Total account value: $9,815.86\n- Available cash: $8,989.19\n- Current positions notional: ~$9,384\n- All three positions are profitable\n- Portfolio is well-diversified across altcoins\n- No new positions warranted given extreme market volatility and bearish conditions\n\n## Other Coins (No Positions)\nBTC, ETH, XRP: Not entering new positions given:\n- Extreme bearish momentum across the board\n- Already have three leveraged positions\n- Market conditions too volatile for new entries\n- Better to preserve capital and manage existing positions\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.085,\n      \"profit_target\": 1120.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1040.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,040 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 550.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 33500.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.188,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.173,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $0.173 on 3-minute candle, breaking recent low\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 550.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 17.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 186.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 172.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $172 on 3-minute candle, confirming further downside\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 525.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The oversold RSI could lead to a bounce toward profit target.\n\n## DOGE Position Analysis\n- Entry: $0.17849, Current: $0.18475 (+$206.72 PnL, +3.5%)\n- Stop-loss: $0.173, Profit target: $0.188\n- **Invalidation condition: \"If price closes below $0.173 on 3-minute candle\"**\n- Current price $0.18475 is well ABOVE invalidation level of $0.173\n- Price is approaching profit target of $0.188 (only $0.0035 away, ~1.9%)\n- Technical indicators showing recovery:\n  - RSI (7-period): 42.470 - neutral, recovering from oversold\n  - RSI (14-period): 37.322 - still recovering\n  - MACD: -0.004 - bearish but improving\n  - Price still below EMA20 ($0.192365) but recovering\n- Strong unrealized profit of $206.72 on $550 risk = 37.6% gain\n- **Decision: CLOSE POSITION** - Taking profits. Price is very close to profit target ($0.188), and given the overall market weakness, it's prudent to lock in this 37.6% gain rather than risk a reversal.\n\n## SOL Position Analysis\n- Entry: $177.65, Current: $182.74 (+$87.52 PnL, +2.9%)\n- Stop-loss: $172.00, Profit target: $186.00\n- **Invalidation condition: \"If price closes below $172 on 3-minute candle\"**\n- Current price $182.74 is well ABOVE invalidation level of $172\n- Price approaching profit target of $186 (only $3.26 away, ~1.8%)\n- Technical indicators showing recovery:\n  - RSI (7-period): 41.565 - neutral, recovering from oversold\n  - RSI (14-period): 36.982 - still recovering\n  - MACD: -3.878 - bearish but stabilizing\n  - Price below EMA20 ($189.96) but recovering from lows\n- Good unrealized profit of $87.52 on $525 risk = 16.7% gain\n- **Decision: HOLD** - Price is moving toward profit target. With only $3.26 to go and RSI showing recovery momentum, I'll hold for the profit target. Invalidation condition not met.\n\n## New Position Opportunities\nReviewing coins without positions:\n\n**BTC**: Price $106,821, severely oversold (RSI 7: 39.583, RSI 14: 35.279), MACD -1257.721. Massive drop from $111,288. Too risky in current volatility.\n\n**ETH**: Price $3,797.30, oversold (RSI 7: 33.917, RSI 14: 33.716), MACD -49.574. Similar weakness to BTC.

However, the market structure is severely broken. RSI at 17.929 is in extreme oversold territory, and the price has crashed ~10% from recent highs. While technically above the invalidation level, the momentum is clearly bearish.\n- **Decision**: CLOSE - The position is barely profitable and showing extreme weakness. RSI at 17.929 indicates panic selling. Better to preserve capital than risk the position moving against stop-loss.\n\n**SOL Position:**\n- Entry: $177.65, Current: $181.93 (+2.41%)\n- Unrealized PnL: +$73.35 (good profit)\n- Stop-loss: $172, Profit target: $186\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below $172 on 3-minute candle\"\n- Current RSI (7-period): 38.373 - oversold but recovering\n- MACD: -5.249 (negative but stabilizing)\n- Price action: Recovered from $177.65 low to $181.93\n- Price is below EMA20 ($190.13) but showing resilience\n- Invalidation NOT met - price well above $172\n- Close to profit target ($186) - only $4.07 away\n- **Decision**: HOLD - Position is profitable, showing recovery momentum, and approaching profit target. No invalidation condition met.\n\n## Market Overview\nAll major coins showing bearish pressure:\n- BTC: RSI 35.342, down from $110,526 to $106,421\n- ETH: RSI 43.710, recovering slightly\n- SOL: RSI 38.373, showing relative strength\n- BNB: RSI 17.929, EXTREME weakness\n- XRP: RSI 41.394, neutral\n- DOGE: RSI 40.757, neutral\n\n## New Position Opportunities\nGiven the current market volatility and my existing exposure, I should not add new positions. The market is in a corrective phase with most coins showing bearish momentum.

Current price is $181.89, well above the $172 invalidation level. The position is in profit (+$72.65) and showing oversold RSI conditions which could lead to a bounce toward the $186 profit target. The stop-loss at $172 provides adequate protection.\n\nHowever, I notice the price is struggling below the EMA20 and MACD remains negative. The position is close to profit target ($4.11 away) but momentum is weak. Given the oversold conditions and that invalidation hasn't triggered, I'll HOLD and let the position work toward the profit target.\n\n**Other Coins - No Entry:**\n- BTC: RSI 35, heavily oversold but in strong downtrend (price $106,396 vs EMA $108,966). Too risky to enter during this volatility.\n- ETH: RSI 45.6, below EMA, negative MACD. Weak setup.\n- BNB: RSI 25 - extremely oversold but in severe downtrend. High risk.\n- XRP: RSI 39.8, below EMA, negative momentum. No clear setup.\n- DOGE: RSI 43.5, below EMA, weak momentum.

Given:\n1. Strong recent momentum (price jumped from $181.89 to $184.74 in last candle)\n2. RSI showing strength without being overbought\n3. Position is profitable and near target\n4. High leverage (15x) means I should take profits when available\n5. Price needs only 0.68% more to hit target\n\nHowever, price is still below EMA20 ($188.99), which could act as resistance. The MACD is still negative, suggesting underlying weakness despite the bounce.\n\n**Risk Management Decision:** \nGiven we're so close to profit target ($1.26 away) and using 15x leverage, I should **TAKE PROFITS NOW** rather than risk a reversal. The position has achieved 3.99% gain, and with 15x leverage, this represents solid execution.

The market appears to be in a recovery phase from oversold conditions, but the trend remains bearish.\n\n**Best opportunity**: **ETH** - Shows strongest recovery momentum with RSI(7) at 56.9, improving MACD, and price action showing resilience. The recovery from $3,756 to $3,876 (+3.2%) shows buying interest.\n\n**Entry Strategy**: \n- Enter ETH long with tight risk management\n- Use 15x leverage for better capital efficiency while maintaining strict stop-loss\n- Risk: $480 (5% of capital)\n- Stop-loss: Below recent low at $3,756 with buffer = $3,740\n- Profit target: Near EMA20 resistance + extension = $3,960\n- Invalidation: If price breaks below $3,740 (recent support fails)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.92,\n      \"profit_target\": 3960.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3740.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,740 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown of recovery support\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 480.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The invalidation condition has NOT been met (price is $152 above the $3,740 threshold). RSI shows healthy bullish momentum without being overbought. The main concern is the very low volume (only 33% of average), which suggests this recovery may lack conviction. However, since:\n1. Invalidation condition is not met\n2. Technical indicators are neutral to slightly bullish\n3. Position is profitable\n4. Stop-loss is well-placed and not threatened\n\nI will **HOLD** the position and let it run toward the $3,960 profit target.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC, SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE: No positions, and current market conditions don't present compelling setups with clear risk/reward.

The position is slightly profitable and has significant room to the profit target ($3,960, +$72.60 away). The stop-loss provides adequate protection. With RSI at 61 (not overbought) and MACD improving, there's potential for continued upside. The invalidation condition is not met, and technical indicators support holding.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Position size: $7,463 notional on $9,623 account = 77.5% exposure (high but manageable with 15x leverage)\n- Distance to liquidation: $269.61 (6.9%) - adequate buffer\n- Risk/reward: $136.20 stop distance vs $72.60 profit target distance - not ideal but position is already in profit\n\n## Market Context for Other Coins\n\n**BTC:** Price $107,143, below EMA20 ($107,939), MACD negative but improving, RSI 55 - neutral. No position, not compelling enough to enter.\n\n**SOL:** Price $187.47, above EMA20 ($186.90), RSI(7) 71.2 - overbought, MACD improving. Strong momentum but RSI too hot for new entry.\n\n**BNB:** Price $1,092, well below EMA20 ($1,112.86), RSI 44.7 - weak, MACD negative. Downtrend, avoid.\n\n**XRP:** Price $2.36, at EMA20 ($2.35), RSI 57 - neutral, MACD improving. Consolidating but no clear edge.\n\n**DOGE:** Price $0.18947, at EMA20 ($0.18923), RSI(7) 72.7 - overbought. Too extended for entry.\n\n**Conclusion:** Hold ETH position as invalidation not met and technicals support continuation.

The position is very close to the profit target ($3,960), only $37.80 away. However, RSI at 71.689 shows overbought conditions which could lead to a pullback. Given:\n1. We're 96% of the way to profit target\n2. RSI is overbought (>70)\n3. Strong momentum but potential for near-term consolidation\n4. 15x leverage means we should take profits when available\n\n**DECISION: CLOSE POSITION** - Taking profits near target with overbought RSI conditions. Better to lock in gains at 15x leverage than risk a reversal.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** No position. Price $107,735, RSI 68.945 approaching overbought. MACD improving but still negative. Not entering.\n\n**SOL:** No position. Price $188.86, RSI 72.313 overbought. Strong momentum but extended. Not entering.\n\n**BNB:** No position. Price $1,099.20 below EMA20 ($1,109.84). RSI 57.771 neutral. Weak relative performance. Not entering.\n\n**XRP:** No position. Price $2.37, RSI 63.348. Consolidating near EMA20. No clear setup. Not entering.\n\n**DOGE:** No position. Price $0.193210, RSI 77.432 very overbought. Extended move.

The price is very close to the profit target ($195.00), just $2.89 away. However, the invalidation conditions are NOT met:\n1. Price is well above $184.00 stop-loss\n2. RSI(7) is at 68.036, comfortably below the 85 threshold\n\nThe momentum remains positive with MACD increasing and price above EMA20. Given that we're so close to the profit target and all conditions remain favorable, I should **HOLD** and let the position reach its profit target naturally.\n\n### Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC**: \n- Extremely overbought with RSI(7) at 85.817\n- Strong uptrend but at elevated levels\n- No position currently - not entering at these overbought levels\n\n**ETH**:\n- RSI(7) at 74.557, showing strength but cooling from 93.803\n- Strong uptrend but also extended\n- No position - waiting for better entry\n\n**BNB**:\n- RSI(7) at 50.811 - neutral zone\n- Recent pullback from $1127.90 to $1114.60\n- Momentum weakening - not attractive for entry\n\n**XRP**:\n- RSI(7) at 75.136, cooling from 88.242\n- Strong uptrend but extended\n- No position - avoiding chase\n\n**DOGE**:\n- RSI(7) at 75.675, cooling from 86.772\n- Strong uptrend but extended\n- No position - avoiding chase\n\n**Conclusion**: Hold SOL position as invalidation conditions are not met and profit target is near.

While the invalidation condition hasn't been technically met yet (price hasn't closed below $184.00), we're only $1.46 away. The sharp decline in RSI to 24.147 shows extreme selling pressure. The price has dropped from $192.93 to $185.46 in recent candles - a $7.47 move against us.\n\n**Risk Management Decision**: \nGiven the proximity to stop-loss ($1.46 buffer), severe bearish momentum, and the fact that we're down -$132.95 on this position, I should close this position proactively. The technical setup has deteriorated significantly, and waiting for the exact stop-loss hit risks slippage and further losses. The invalidation condition is essentially being approached.\n\n**Decision**: CLOSE POSITION - Risk management, price approaching stop-loss with strong bearish momentum\n\n## Market Opportunities Assessment\n\n### BTC Analysis\n- Price: $109,008, below recent highs of $111,161\n- RSI(7): 26.889 (extremely oversold)\n- RSI(14): 45.497 (neutral)\n- Sharp selloff from $111,161 to $109,008\n- Still above EMA20 ($108,873.94) but barely\n- MACD declining sharply: 1,136.221 \u2192 1,001.452\n\n**Assessment**: Oversold but momentum is clearly bearish. Not entering.\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- Price: $3,922.60\n- RSI(7): 20.020 (extremely oversold)\n- Below EMA20 ($3,944.83)\n- Sharp decline from $4,053.40 to $3,922.60\n- MACD declining: 49.182 \u2192 35.281\n\n**Assessment**: Extremely oversold but in downtrend. Too risky.\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- Price: $1,081.30\n- RSI(7): 16.018 (extremely oversold - most oversold of all)\n- Below EMA20 ($1,099.32)\n- Sharp decline from $1,127.90 to $1,081.30\n- MACD declining: 12.027 \u2192 5.756\n\n**Assessment**: Most oversold but strongest downtrend. Avoid.\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- Price: $2.45\n- RSI(7): 45.061 (neutral)\n- Above EMA20 ($2.41) \u2713\n- MACD: 0.045 (positive but declining)\n- Relative strength compared to others\n\n**Assessment**: XRP showing relative strength - above EMA20, RSI not oversold, maintaining better than other coins. However, still in pullback mode.\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- Price: $0.196520\n- RSI(7): 33.772 (oversold but not extreme)\n- Above EMA20 ($0.194510) \u2713\n- MACD: 0.004 (positive)\n- Pullback from $0.201150\n\n**Assessment**: Above EMA20, moderate oversold. Neutral.\n\n## Overall Market Context\nAll major coins showing sharp selloffs with extremely oversold RSI readings (BTC: 26.9, ETH: 20.0, SOL: 24.1, BNB: 16.0). This suggests a broad market correction in progress. Not an ideal time to enter new positions given the strong bearish momentum across the board.\n\n## Final Decision\nClose SOL position to preserve capital and avoid further losses as price approaches stop-loss.

I need to analyze whether current market conditions present good entry opportunities.\n\n### Market Overview:\nAll major coins are showing significant weakness:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $108,019 (down from $111,161 high)\n- RSI(7): 18.02 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 35.28 - Oversold territory\n- MACD: 691.8 (declining from 1003.97)\n- Price below EMA20 ($108,879.80)\n- Sharp selloff from recent highs - down ~$3,000 in 30 minutes\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,891.90 (down from $4,053.40 high)\n- RSI(7): 14.59 - EXTREMELY oversold (most oversold of all coins)\n- RSI(14): 30.72 - Oversold\n- MACD: 19.76 (declining from 40.07)\n- Price below EMA20 ($3,945.06)\n- Severe selloff - down ~$160 from highs\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $184.93 (down from $192.93 high)\n- RSI(7): 22.17 - Extremely oversold\n- RSI(14): 34.60 - Oversold\n- MACD: 0.615 (declining)\n- Price below EMA20 ($187.86)\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,071.30 (down from $1,127.90 high)\n- RSI(7): 11.74 - MOST OVERSOLD of all coins\n- RSI(14): 26.74 - Deeply oversold\n- MACD: -0.513 (negative and declining)\n- Price below EMA20 ($1,099.19)\n- Down ~$57 from highs\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.43 (down from $2.52 high)\n- RSI(7): 35.45 - Oversold but less extreme\n- RSI(14): 47.79 - Near neutral\n- MACD: 0.032 (still positive but declining)\n- Price above EMA20 ($2.42) - ONLY coin above EMA20\n- Showing relative strength\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.19416 (down from $0.20115 high)\n- RSI(7): 22.81 - Extremely oversold\n- RSI(14): 41.28 - Approaching oversold\n- MACD: 0.003 (declining)\n- Price below EMA20 ($0.19476)\n\n## Trading Decision:\n\nThe market is experiencing a sharp correction with ALL coins showing extreme oversold conditions on the 7-period RSI. This presents potential mean-reversion opportunities, but the momentum is strongly bearish.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. BNB has RSI(7) of 11.74 - the most extreme oversold reading\n2. ETH has RSI(7) of 14.59 - second most oversold\n3. All coins below their EMA20 except XRP (barely above)\n4. Volume is elevated, suggesting panic selling\n5. MACD declining across all coins\n\n**Strategy:**\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions, I'll enter a SMALL position in BNB as a mean-reversion play. BNB has:\n- Most extreme oversold RSI(7) at 11.74\n- RSI(14) at 26.74 (deeply oversold)\n- Clear support zone around $1,070\n- High probability of short-term bounce\n\nI'll use conservative position sizing (risk ~$300) with tight stop-loss given the strong bearish momentum. This is a tactical bounce play, not a trend trade.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.26,\n      \"profit_target\": 1095.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1060.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,060 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown of support\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 294.38\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The condition is NOT met yet.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Position is barely profitable (+$1.11)\n- Strong bearish momentum (MACD -7.363, declining)\n- Deeply oversold RSI could mean bounce or continued selling\n- Price is $16.10 away from stop-loss\n- We're in a clear downtrend (price < EMA20, negative MACD)\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nWhile BNB is deeply oversold and could bounce, the technical picture is concerning:\n1. Strong bearish MACD divergence\n2. Price well below EMA20\n3. Consistent downward pressure\n4. Very small profit buffer\n\nHowever, the invalidation condition has NOT been met (price still above $1,060). The deeply oversold RSI (23.919) suggests we may be near a short-term bottom. Given that:\n- We entered at the recent low ($1,071.30)\n- RSI is extremely oversold (potential bounce zone)\n- Stop-loss is clearly defined at $1,060\n- Invalidation condition not triggered\n\nI will HOLD the position but remain vigilant. If the next candle shows weakness toward $1,060, we should exit immediately.\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- BTC: RSI 33.958 (oversold), below EMA, no position\n- ETH: RSI 14.200 (extremely oversold), below EMA, no position  \n- SOL: RSI 37.101 (oversold), below EMA, no position\n- XRP: RSI 38.327, above EMA, showing relative strength\n- DOGE: RSI 26.377 (oversold), at EMA\n\nMarket-wide selling pressure evident. Not entering new positions in this volatile environment with portfolio already down -4.54%.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.26,\n      \"profit_target\": 1095.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1060.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,060 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown of support\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 294.38\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The previous candle showed RSI at 17.9 (oversold), now at 79.9 - this is a violent reversal that may not sustain\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- **Current price: $4,082.90** (similar spike from $3,890 to $4,082 - +4.9% move)\n- Price above EMA20 ($3,954.66)\n- RSI(7): 78.1 - overbought\n- MACD: 21.24 - positive momentum recovering\n- Volume: 231,760 vs avg 81,485 - **2.8x average volume**\n- Similar parabolic pattern to BTC\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- **Current price: $196.14** (spike from $186.17 to $196.14 - +5.4% move)\n- Price above EMA20 ($188.66)\n- RSI(7): 79.5 - overbought\n- MACD: 0.823 - positive but weaker than BTC/ETH\n- Volume: 1,452,713 vs avg 527,924 - **2.75x average volume**\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- **Current price: $1,111.50** (recovery from $1,076 to $1,111 - +3.3% move)\n- Price above EMA20 ($1,099.82)\n- RSI(7): 68.3 - elevated but not overbought\n- MACD: -2.844 - still negative, weakest momentum\n- Volume: 10,395 vs avg 6,623 - 1.57x average\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- **Current price: $2.52** (spike from $2.43 to $2.52 - +3.7% move)\n- Price above EMA20 ($2.43)\n- RSI(7): 72.7 - elevated\n- MACD: 0.027 - positive but weak\n- Volume: 12,979,067 vs avg 5,051,749 - **2.57x average volume**\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- **Current price: $0.20424** (spike from $0.19443 to $0.20424 - +5.0% move)\n- Price above EMA20 ($0.195765)\n- RSI(7): 77.5 - overbought\n- MACD: 0.003 - positive\n- Volume: 44,978,458 vs avg 20,945,883 - **2.15x average volume**\n\n## Trading Decision Rationale\n\n**Key Observation**: All coins just experienced simultaneous parabolic moves with 3-5% gains in a single 3-minute candle on massive volume. This is likely a coordinated market event (possibly news-driven or liquidation cascade).\n\n**Risk Assessment**:\n1. Entering at the top of parabolic moves is extremely risky\n2. RSI levels are overbought across the board\n3. These moves often retrace 30-50% quickly\n4. My current -4.45% return suggests I need to be more selective\n\n**Strategy**: \n- **WAIT** - Do not chase parabolic moves\n- These setups have very poor risk/reward at current levels\n- Better to wait for a pullback to EMA20 or support levels\n- If I enter now and get a 5% reversal, I'd be down another 50% on a leveraged position\n\n**Conclusion**: No trades. Preserve capital and wait for better entry points. The market just moved violently in one direction - the probability of continuation without retracement is low.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

Therefore, the invalidation condition is NOT met.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nDespite the position being slightly underwater (-$18.57), the invalidation condition has not been triggered. The price is holding above the critical $2.38 level. RSI at 32.39 suggests oversold conditions which could lead to a bounce. However, the bearish momentum (price below EMA, declining MACD) is concerning.\n\nGiven that:\n1. Invalidation condition NOT met (price > $2.38)\n2. Stop-loss NOT hit\n3. RSI oversold could mean reversal potential\n4. Small loss (-0.43%) within acceptable range\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - Continue monitoring but maintain position as exit conditions are not met.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, DOGE: No positions, not entering new trades given current market volatility and downward pressure across all assets (all showing RSI < 45, prices below EMAs).\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1600.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.52,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.38,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.38 (below recent low) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 640.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Looking at the price action:\n- Price has been declining: 2.49 \u2192 2.45 \u2192 2.43 \u2192 2.43 \u2192 2.52 (spike) \u2192 2.49 \u2192 2.42 \u2192 2.42 \u2192 2.41 \u2192 2.39\n- Current price 2.3946 is very near the invalidation level of 2.38\n- RSI (7-period) at 28.032 shows oversold conditions but continuing to decline\n- RSI (14-period) at 39.152 also weak\n- MACD at 0.014 is barely positive and declining\n- Price is below EMA20 (2.43), showing bearish momentum\n- The recent candles show consistent selling pressure\n\n**Risk Management Decision:**\nWith price at 2.3946 and stop-loss at 2.38, I'm only 0.6% away from being stopped out. The technical indicators show continued weakness with no signs of reversal. The invalidation condition is essentially being tested right now. Rather than wait for a potential gap through my stop-loss or further deterioration, I should close this position to preserve capital.\n\n**Other Coins Assessment:**\n- BTC: RSI 30.867 (oversold), price 107502 below EMA 108979, MACD declining - bearish\n- ETH: RSI 28.247 (oversold), price 3827.60 below EMA 3924.15, MACD negative - bearish  \n- SOL: RSI 34.975 (weak), price 184.99 below EMA 187.77, MACD negative - bearish\n- BNB: RSI 40.325 (weak), price 1068.70 below EMA 1085.93, MACD negative - bearish\n- DOGE: RSI 26.207 (oversold), price 0.19086 below EMA 0.195075, MACD barely positive - bearish\n\nAll coins are showing bearish technical conditions with prices below their EMAs, weak RSI readings, and negative or declining MACD. This is not an environment to open new positions. The market appears to be in a corrective phase.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nClose XRP position due to proximity to stop-loss and continued bearish momentum.

While oversold conditions exist, there are no bullish reversal confirmations (MACD crosses, price above EMA, etc.). Given my poor performance, capital preservation is paramount.

Looking at the RSI(7) series:\n- Started at 17.080 (extremely oversold)\n- Now at 45.785 (recovered strongly above 30)\n- The RSI has successfully recovered above 30, so invalidation is NOT triggered\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Stop-loss at $177.50 is $5.29 away (2.89% buffer)\n- Profit target at $188.00 is $5.21 away (2.85% gain needed)\n- Risk/reward ratio is approximately 1:1\n- Position is slightly profitable but showing mixed signals\n\n**Market Context:**\n- SOL showing weakness relative to EMA20 (below by $3.11)\n- MACD still negative (bearish momentum)\n- RSI recovered but not showing strong bullish momentum\n- Price bounced from $180 support but struggling to break higher\n- Volume below average (523K vs 754K average)\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe invalidation condition has NOT been met - RSI(7) successfully recovered above 30. However, the technical picture is mixed:\n- Positive: Above stop-loss, RSI recovered, small profit\n- Negative: Below EMA20, negative MACD, weak volume, struggling momentum\n\nGiven that:\n1. Invalidation NOT triggered\n2. Stop-loss not hit ($177.50 vs current $182.79)\n3. Profit target not reached ($188.00 vs current $182.79)\n4. Position showing small profit (+$175)\n5. RSI recovery suggests potential for continuation\n\n**DECISION: HOLD** - The position remains valid per its exit plan. The RSI recovery satisfies the invalidation condition, and we're above the stop-loss with room to reach the profit target.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, DOGE:** No positions. Given current portfolio drawdown (-19.57%) and existing SOL exposure, I will not open new positions at this time. Focus on managing existing risk.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 65.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 188.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 177.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 177.50 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 30 within next 5 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 162.5\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, extreme RSI suggests imminent reversal risk\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- At 15x leverage, a $6.53 move down would hit stop-loss ($191.27 - $179.50 = $11.77 buffer)\n- That's a 6.1% move, which at 15x leverage = 91.5% of position value\n- Current unrealized gain: $103.55 vs initial risk: $400\n- Risk/reward from here: Limited upside ($3.73 to target) vs significant downside risk\n\n**Decision: HOLD but with caution**\n- Invalidation condition is NOT met (price above $184.00)\n- Position is profitable and approaching profit target\n- Despite extreme RSI, MACD momentum is positive\n- Will let the position run to either profit target ($195) or stop-loss ($179.50)\n- The extreme RSI is concerning, but the invalidation rule is clear and not triggered\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** Price $110,063, above EMA20 ($109,421). RSI 70.2 overbought, MACD improving. Strong momentum but no position. Not entering at overbought levels.\n\n**ETH:** Price $3,857, below EMA20 ($3,884). RSI 48.5 neutral, MACD negative. Weak momentum, below key moving average. Not attractive.\n\n**BNB:** Price $1,125.70, above EMA20 ($1,096). RSI 68.7 overbought, MACD positive. Strong rally but already extended. Not entering.\n\n**XRP:** Price $2.39, below EMA20 ($2.42). RSI 43.4 neutral-weak, MACD negative. Downtrend, not attractive.\n\n**DOGE:** Price $0.19478, at EMA20 ($0.19481). RSI 58.7 neutral, MACD flat. No clear direction, not compelling.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 32.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 179.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $184.00 on 3-minute candle, indicating failed breakout above EMA20\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Looking at the recent candles, we had closes below $184 earlier (180.17, 180.00, 182.79) but those were BEFORE the breakout\n- Current price is $191.21, well above $184.00\n- **Invalidation condition is NOT met** - price has not closed below $184 since the breakout\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n- RSI (7-period): 80.326 - EXTREMELY overbought (above 80)\n- RSI (14-period): 66.251 - overbought territory\n- MACD: 0.327 - positive and improving (was negative, now positive)\n- Price vs EMA20: $191.21 vs $187.94 (+1.74% above EMA20)\n- Recent momentum: Strong upward move from $180 to $191.21\n- Volume: 587,149 vs average 773,558 (below average but acceptable)\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- The RSI at 80+ is a warning sign of potential exhaustion\n- Price is approaching profit target ($195.00, only $3.79 away)\n- Stop-loss at $179.50 provides good protection\n- Unrealized profit of $101.63 on $400 risk = 25% gain\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nWhile RSI is extremely overbought (80.3), the invalidation condition has NOT been met. Price remains well above $184.00 and is trending toward the profit target at $195.00. The MACD just turned positive, suggesting continued momentum. Given that:\n1.

While invalidation condition not technically met, the risk/reward is unfavorable with RSI in danger zone and profit target nearly reached. Better to lock in gains than risk a sharp reversal from these extreme levels.\n\n## Other Coins Analysis\n\n### BTC\n- Price: $111,072, RSI: 84.563 (extremely overbought)\n- Strong uptrend but overextended\n- No position, not entering at these extreme levels\n\n### ETH\n- Price: $3,950.10, RSI: 83.272 (extremely overbought)\n- Similar to BTC - overextended\n- No position, avoiding entry\n\n### BNB\n- Price: $1,124.90, RSI: 59.644 (neutral)\n- More reasonable RSI but less conviction\n- No position, passing\n\n### XRP\n- Price: $2.44, RSI: 76.650 (overbought)\n- Gaining momentum but already extended\n- No position, passing\n\n### DOGE\n- Price: $0.196590, RSI: 74.313 (overbought)\n- Similar pattern to others\n- No position, passing\n\n**Overall Market Assessment**: All major coins showing extreme overbought conditions (RSI 74-85 range).

However, XRP is showing exceptional relative strength:\n\n1. **XRP stands out:** Only coin maintaining upward momentum with RSI(7) at 87.32\n2. **Volume confirmation:** 62% above average volume supports the move\n3. **MACD just turned positive:** Fresh momentum signal\n4. **Price well above EMA20:** $2.48 vs $2.42 shows strength\n\n**Risk Consideration:** With current drawdown at -15.52% and poor Sharpe ratio, I need to be selective. XRP's extreme overbought condition (RSI 87.32) is concerning, but the relative strength during market-wide weakness suggests institutional accumulation or strong buying pressure.\n\n**Decision:** Take a small, calculated position in XRP with tight risk management. Use lower leverage (12x) given the overbought condition and set stop-loss just below recent support.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1700,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.58,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.38,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.38 (recent support) or RSI(7) drops below 40 indicating momentum failure\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 700\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price below $109,500? NO - currently at $111,551 (well above)\n2. MACD negative? NO - MACD at 783.443 (very positive and rising)\n3. Conclusion: **Invalidation condition NOT met**\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Position is slightly profitable (+0.44%)\n- RSI showing overbought conditions (77.864) - potential for pullback\n- MACD strongly positive and accelerating - momentum intact\n- Price action showing strength with recent spike to $111,551\n- Stop-loss at $109,500 provides $2,051 cushion (1.84%)\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe BTC position remains valid. While RSI is elevated suggesting overbought conditions, the MACD is strongly positive and accelerating, indicating continued momentum. The invalidation conditions are not met - price is well above $109,500 and MACD is positive. The small profit suggests the trade is working as intended. Given the strong momentum indicators and no breach of exit conditions, I will HOLD this position.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**ETH:** No position. RSI 58.643 (neutral), MACD positive but weak (20.684). Price above EMA20. Moderate setup but not compelling enough to enter with limited capital.\n\n**SOL:** No position. RSI 73.932 (overbought), MACD positive (2.232). Strong momentum but already extended. Risk of pullback too high.\n\n**BNB:** No position. RSI 48.077 (neutral), MACD positive (11.244) but declining. Weak momentum, consolidating. No clear edge.\n\n**XRP:** No position. RSI 95.627 (extremely overbought!), MACD positive (0.029). Parabolic move from $2.41 to $2.54. This is a blow-off top pattern - extremely dangerous to enter. High probability of sharp reversal.\n\n**DOGE:** No position. RSI 70.674 (overbought), MACD positive (0.001). Extended but not as extreme as XRP. No compelling entry.\n\n**Portfolio Risk:** Currently using $6,023.75 of notional exposure (60% of account). With account down -15.01%, I need to be selective. Only BTC position is active and showing slight profit. Will maintain discipline and not force new trades.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.054,\n      \"profit_target\": 114500.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 109500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $109,500 or MACD turns negative on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price below $109,500? NO - currently at $111,669 (well above)\n2. MACD negative? NO - MACD is 781.838 and rising (positive momentum)\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe BTC position is performing well with both invalidation conditions NOT met. The MACD remains strongly positive and trending upward, indicating continued bullish momentum. Price is $2,169 above the stop-loss level, providing good cushion. RSI at 72 shows strength without extreme overbought conditions (not above 80). The position has room to run toward the $114,500 profit target.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Position is small (0.054 BTC, ~$6,030 notional with 15x leverage)\n- Stop-loss properly placed at $109,500\n- Account has $8,074 cash available\n- Current drawdown: -14.94% (manageable)\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- **XRP**: RSI at 98.46 - EXTREMELY overbought, dangerous to enter\n- **ETH**: RSI 72.27 - elevated, already missed entry\n- **SOL**: RSI 68.51 - decent but no clear setup\n- **BNB**: RSI 56.61 - neutral, no compelling signal\n- **DOGE**: RSI 56.38 - neutral, choppy action\n\n**Conclusion:** HOLD BTC position as neither invalidation condition is met. The technical setup remains bullish with positive MACD momentum and price well above critical support levels.

ALL coins are showing overbought conditions with RSI(7) above 80. This is a classic late-stage rally where entering now would be chasing momentum at the worst possible time.\n\nThe prudent decision is to **WAIT FOR PULLBACKS**. Entering at these extreme overbought levels would likely result in immediate drawdown and further damage to the portfolio.\n\n## Trading Decision\n\n**NO TRADES** - All assets are extremely overbought. The risk/reward is unfavorable for new entries. I will wait for:\n1. RSI to cool off below 70\n2. Price to pull back to EMA20 or support levels\n3. Better entry opportunities with defined risk\n\nPreserving capital is more important than forcing trades in overextended conditions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

Current price $200.05 is well above the $192.00 threshold. The position remains valid.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- RSI at 81.699 indicates extreme overbought conditions - high risk of pullback\n- Position is only up 0.63% with 15x leverage - minimal profit cushion\n- Stop-loss at $192.00 is $8.05 away (4% move, but 60% loss with 15x leverage)\n- Profit target at $206.00 is $5.95 away (3% move, 45% gain with 15x leverage)\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nWhile the invalidation condition is not met, the extreme RSI readings (81.699 on 7-period, 76.567 on 14-period) suggest imminent mean reversion risk. However, MACD is strongly positive and trending up, and price is above all EMAs showing continued bullish momentum. The position has small unrealized profit and the invalidation level has not been breached.\n\nGiven:\n1. Invalidation condition NOT met ($200.05 > $192.00)\n2. Strong MACD momentum continuing\n3. Price above EMA20 with uptrend intact\n4. Small but positive P&L\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - The position remains valid per its exit plan. While overbought, the momentum is strong and invalidation has not occurred.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** RSI 90.863 (extremely overbought), strong momentum but no position. Too risky to enter at these levels.\n\n**ETH:** RSI 91.977 (extremely overbought), similar to BTC - too extended to enter.\n\n**BNB:** RSI 73.134 (overbought but less extreme), positive MACD but not compelling enough for new entry.\n\n**XRP:** RSI 70.165 (moderately overbought), consolidating after extreme readings.\n\n**DOGE:** RSI 82.222 (overbought), strong momentum but high risk at current levels.\n\nAll markets are showing overbought conditions.

Current price is $2.66 and EMA20 is $2.59. The price has NOT closed below $2.54, so the invalidation condition is NOT met.\n\n**Stop Loss Check**: \nStop loss at $2.54 has not been hit. Current price $2.66 is well above.\n\n**Profit Target Check**:\nProfit target at $2.78 has not been reached. Current price $2.66 is $0.12 away.\n\n**Decision**: HOLD - Position is profitable, trend remains intact above EMA20, no invalidation conditions met. RSI shows strength but not extreme overbought levels that would warrant immediate exit. The uptrend structure is preserved.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n### BTC\n- Strong uptrend: Price $114,992 well above EMA20 $113,159\n- RSI cooling from extreme levels (94.47 \u2192 65.89), healthy pullback\n- MACD strong at 1077.49\n- However, recent pullback from $115,566 to $114,992\n- **Decision**: No position, not entering - waiting for clearer setup after RSI cooldown\n\n### ETH\n- Strong momentum: Price $4,173.90 above EMA20 $4,054.69\n- RSI (7): 69.05, RSI (14): 74.10 - moderate overbought\n- MACD positive at 62.56\n- Recent slight pullback from $4,206\n- **Decision**: No position, not entering - similar to BTC, waiting for better entry\n\n### SOL\n- Price $200.10 above EMA20 $197.08\n- RSI (7): 50.71 - neutral zone\n- Pulled back from $204.39 high\n- MACD positive but declining (2.46 \u2192 2.40)\n- **Decision**: No position, not entering - momentum fading\n\n### BNB\n- Sharp pullback: $1,180 \u2192 $1,143.40 (significant drop)\n- RSI (7): 45.66 - dropped sharply from 93.08\n- Price still above EMA20 $1,134.30 but weakening\n- **Decision**: No position, not entering - bearish reversal pattern\n\n### DOGE\n- Price $0.2028 slightly above EMA20 $0.2008\n- RSI (7): 45.30 - neutral/weak\n- Pulled back from highs\n- **Decision**: No position, not entering - weak momentum\n\n## Risk Management\n- Current account value: $8,835.05\n- Available cash: $8,524.81\n- Single position (XRP) at $3,990 notional = 45% of account\n- Position is profitable and following plan\n- Portfolio Sharpe: -3.661 (negative, but improving with profitable XRP trade)\n\n## Conclusion\nXRP position should be held as all conditions remain favorable and invalidation has not been triggered. No new positions warranted given current market conditions showing pullbacks across most assets.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1500.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.78,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.54,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.54 (EMA20 support) on 3-minute candle, indicating trend breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, already have XRP exposure and don't want to over-leverage portfolio.\n\n**ETH:** Very strong momentum (price $4,194 vs EMA20 $4,060), RSI 75 showing strength. Similar reasoning - maintaining focus on existing position.\n\n**SOL:** Price $199.97 near EMA20 $196.98, but RSI dropped to 49.5 (neutral), losing momentum. Not compelling entry.\n\n**BNB:** Price $1,144.70 above EMA20 $1,132.40, but RSI dropped sharply to 47 from 93.4, indicating momentum exhaustion. Avoid.\n\n**DOGE:** Price $0.203 slightly above EMA20 $0.2007, RSI 47.6 neutral. Weak setup, no edge.\n\n**Risk Management:** With -11.53% portfolio drawdown, maintaining discipline on existing profitable position is prudent.

Could bounce, but momentum is clearly broken short-term. **PASS** - too risky after such a sharp reversal.\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- Similar pattern: $4,206 \u2192 $4,093 (-2.7%)\n- RSI(7): 31.908 - **oversold**\n- RSI(14): 48.285 - neutral\n- Price above EMA20: $4,093 > $4,074 \u2713\n- MACD declining: 56.516\n\n**Assessment**: Oversold but showing weakness. **PASS** - similar concerns as BTC.\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- Price: $201.24 vs EMA20: $198.05 \u2713\n- RSI(7): 62.230 - **healthy neutral zone**\n- RSI(14): 62.002 - balanced\n- MACD: 1.888 - positive and stable\n- Recent action: Bounced from $198.66 to $201.24\n- Strong uptrend: 20EMA > 50EMA ($198.05 > $195.90)\n\n**Assessment**: **BEST SETUP** - SOL showing relative strength. While BTC/ETH crashed, SOL held support and is recovering. RSI in healthy zone (not overbought), MACD positive, price above rising EMA20. This is a momentum continuation play.\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- Volatile: Spiked to $1,180, now $1,137.50\n- RSI(7): 39.738 - weak\n- Price above EMA20 but losing momentum\n\n**Assessment**: **PASS** - choppy action, losing momentum.\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- RSI(7): 23.695 - **extremely oversold**\n- Price below EMA20: $0.1996 < $0.2009 \u2717\n- Weak structure\n\n**Assessment**: **PASS** - oversold but broken structure.\n\n## Risk Management Review\n- Current account: $8,786.73\n- Available cash: $8,524.81\n- XRP position: $3,944.85 notional (45% of account)\n- Current drawdown: -12.13%\n- Sharpe ratio: -3.661 (poor risk-adjusted returns)\n\n**Portfolio Decision**: With only one small losing position and strong cash reserves, I can afford to add a high-conviction trade.

Invalidation condition NOT met. Position showing small profit and maintaining support levels.\n\n## SOL Position Analysis\n- Entry: $201.24, Current: $199.69 (-$41.27 unrealized PnL, -2.05%)\n- Stop-loss: $195.00, Profit target: $210.00\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below $195.00 (below 50EMA support) on 3-minute candle\"\n- Current EMA20: $198.63 (price above EMA20 \u2713)\n- Technical indicators:\n  - RSI(7): 43.254 (oversold territory, potential bounce)\n  - RSI(14): 51.180 (neutral)\n  - MACD: 1.771 (positive but declining from 2.004)\n  - Price action: Recent drop from $202.32 to $199.69\n- Recent trajectory: Volatile swings - spiked to $204.39, pulled back, now at $199.69\n- Current price ($199.69) is ABOVE stop-loss ($195.00) by $4.69 (2.4% buffer)\n- **Critical assessment**: Price is weakening but still $4.69 above stop-loss. RSI(7) at 43.254 suggests oversold conditions that could bounce. However, the downward momentum is concerning.\n- **Decision: HOLD** - Invalidation condition NOT met (price still above $195.00). Will let stop-loss work as designed. RSI oversold suggests potential bounce opportunity.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n- **BTC**: Strong uptrend (price $114,350 above EMA20 $113,675), RSI(7) 50.928 (neutral after cooling from overbought), MACD positive. However, already have 2 positions and limited capital ($8,186 available). Not entering.\n- **ETH**: Price $4,111.80 above EMA20 $4,080.68, but RSI(7) 41.936 shows weakness, MACD declining. Recent pullback from $4,206. Not compelling enough with limited capital.\n- **BNB**: Price $1,131.80 BELOW EMA20 $1,133.99, RSI(7) 33.529 (oversold), declining momentum. Weak setup.\n- **DOGE**: Price $0.19965 BELOW EMA20 $0.20074, RSI(7) 29.421 (very oversold), declining trend. Too weak.\n\n## Risk Management Review\n- Current account value: $8,756.68 (down 12.43%)\n- Open positions: 2 (XRP +$14, SOL -$41)\n- Net unrealized PnL: -$27.04\n- Both positions have proper stop-losses in place\n- Neither invalidation condition has been triggered\n- Portfolio exposure: ~$9,000 notional across 2 positions with 15x leverage\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1500.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.78,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.54,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.54 (EMA20 support) on 3-minute candle, indicating trend breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 25.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 210.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 195.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $195.00 (below 50EMA support) on 3-minute candle, indicating trend failure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 450.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

While the invalidation condition hasn't been technically met (price hasn't closed BELOW $2.54), the current price is sitting exactly at EMA20 support with very weak momentum. The MACD is near zero, indicating no clear directional bias. The recovery from $2.60 to $2.63 shows some buying interest, but RSI is only at neutral levels.\n\n**Risk Considerations:**\n- 15x leverage makes this position very sensitive to small moves\n- Only up $4.48 on a $3,950 notional position\n- Price is hovering right at EMA20 support with no clear momentum\n- Account is down -13.62% overall, need to preserve capital\n- Volume is significantly below average (1.97M vs 6.92M average)\n\n**Decision:** HOLD for now. The invalidation condition has NOT been met - price has not closed below $2.54. The recent bounce from $2.60 to $2.63 and RSI recovery from 20.975 to 57.614 suggests buyers are defending this level. The EMA20 is flat at $2.63, providing support. I'll maintain the position but watch closely for any break below $2.54.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC: Below EMA20, weak momentum, RSI neutral - no clear setup\n- ETH: Below EMA20, RSI weak at 40.343, bearish - no entry\n- SOL: Below EMA20, weak RSI at 41.228 - no entry\n- BNB: Below EMA20, MACD negative, weak - no entry\n- DOGE: Significantly below EMA20, RSI oversold at 30.144 - too risky\n\nNo new positions warranted.

Price holding above EMA20 support ($2.63)\n2. Strong RSI recovery indicating renewed buying pressure\n3. MACD turning positive after being negative\n4. No invalidation condition met\n5. Recent price action shows recovery from $2.60 to $2.65\n6. Volume lower than average but price action constructive\n\nThe invalidation condition is clear and NOT met. Price would need to drop $0.11 (4.2%) to hit the stop-loss at $2.54. Current momentum is positive with RSI at 67, suggesting continuation potential toward the $2.78 profit target.\n\n**Other Coins Assessment:**\n- **BTC**: Below EMA20 ($113,134 vs $113,552), RSI weak at 41, MACD declining - No entry\n- **ETH**: Below EMA20 ($4,009 vs $4,055), RSI weak at 34, bearish - No entry\n- **SOL**: Above EMA20 ($198.84 vs $197.55), RSI strong at 65, but already extended - No entry\n- **BNB**: Below EMA20 ($1,113 vs $1,126), RSI weak at 39, MACD negative - No entry\n- **DOGE**: Below EMA20 ($0.195 vs $0.198), RSI weak at 42, bearish - No entry\n\nMarket showing mixed signals with most coins below their EMAs except SOL and XRP.

Price closed below $2.54 on the current 3-minute candle ($2.5488). While RSI is extremely oversold which could suggest a bounce, the stop-loss has been breached and the invalidation condition explicitly states this scenario requires exit. Risk management principles dictate we must honor our predefined exit rules.\n\n## Market Scan for New Opportunities\n\n**BTC**: \n- RSI 13.152 - extremely oversold (lowest reading)\n- Price $110,102 vs EMA20 $113,027 - trading 2.6% below\n- MACD deeply negative at -711.987\n- Strong downtrend but showing extreme oversold conditions\n- Could be setting up for mean reversion bounce\n- **Potential opportunity** but need confirmation\n\n**ETH**:\n- RSI 13.487 - extremely oversold\n- Price $3,902 vs EMA20 $4,032 - trading 3.2% below\n- Similar oversold pattern to BTC\n- Potential bounce candidate\n\n**SOL**:\n- RSI 38.638 - approaching oversold but not extreme\n- Price $193.99 vs EMA20 $197.29 - only 1.7% below\n- Showing relative strength vs other coins\n- MACD -1.258 - mild negative\n- **Best relative strength** among all coins\n\n**BNB**:\n- RSI 41.918 - neutral territory\n- Price $1,107.20 vs EMA20 $1,121.28 - 1.3% below\n- Holding up better than most\n\n**DOGE**:\n- RSI 36.784 - oversold but recovering\n- Price below EMA20 by 2.5%\n\n**Strategy**: Given the extreme oversold conditions across the board (BTC and ETH RSI < 15), there's potential for mean reversion bounces. However, the broader trend is clearly down. I'll close the XRP position per invalidation rules and look for a tactical bounce play on the most oversold asset with clear risk parameters.\n\n**New Trade Consideration**: BTC at RSI 13.152 represents an extreme oversold condition. Historical RSI readings below 15 often lead to short-term bounces. Will enter a small position with tight stop-loss for mean reversion play.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 1500.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.78,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.54,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.54 (EMA20 support) on 3-minute candle, indicating trend breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation condition met - price closed below $2.54 at $2.5488, breaching stop-loss level and EMA20 support\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.04,\n      \"profit_target\": 112500.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 108500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price makes new low below $109,000 or RSI fails to recover above 25 within next 3 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.58,\n      \"risk_usd\": 350.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, the technical picture remains concerning:\n- MACD at -965 shows extreme bearish momentum\n- Price struggling below EMA20\n- Weak volume on the bounce\n- Small profit of only $27 on a 12x leveraged position\n\nGiven the weak technical setup and minimal profit, I should consider taking the small win and exiting. The bounce appears weak and the broader trend remains bearish. With 12x leverage, a reversal could quickly turn this small profit into a loss.\n\n**DECISION: CLOSE POSITION** - Taking the small profit while available. The technical setup remains bearish despite the invalidation condition not being met. Risk management suggests exiting this weak bounce rather than hoping for continuation to $112,500 against strong bearish momentum.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**ETH:** No position. RSI(7) 36.35, deeply oversold but MACD -61.46 shows strong bearish momentum. Price $3,933 vs EMA20 $4,036 (-2.5%). Not entering.\n\n**SOL:** No position. RSI(7) 58.85 showing recovery, price $197.17 near EMA20 $197.45. MACD -1.33 slightly negative. Neutral setup, not compelling.\n\n**BNB:** No position. RSI(7) 62.01 showing strength, price $1,118 near EMA20 $1,123. MACD -8.59 negative. Mixed signals, passing.\n\n**XRP:** No position. RSI(7) 38.98, price $2.58 below EMA20 $2.62. MACD -0.015 negative. Weak setup.\n\n**DOGE:** No position. RSI(7) 48.13, price $0.1937 below EMA20 $0.1974. MACD -0.003 negative. No edge.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.04,\n      \"profit_target\": 112500.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 108500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price makes new low below $109,000 or RSI fails to recover above 25 within next 3 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.58,\n      \"risk_usd\": 350.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - taking small profit on weak bounce.

Extremely oversold RSI readings (most below 20 on 7-period)\n2. Sharp price declines with high volume\n3. Prices significantly below EMAs\n4. Negative and declining MACD\n\n**Mean Reversion Opportunity**: When RSI(7) drops below 15-20 with volume spikes, we often see short-term bounces. The risk/reward favors counter-trend long positions with tight stops.\n\n**Best Candidates for Mean Reversion Longs**:\n1. **ETH** - RSI(7) at 10.29 (most oversold), 2.22x volume spike\n2. **DOGE** - RSI(7) at 10.70, massive 3.45x volume spike (panic selling)\n3. **XRP** - RSI(7) at 12.08, strong volume\n\nI'll enter small positions in ETH and DOGE with tight stop-losses below recent lows, targeting quick mean reversion bounces back toward EMA20 levels.\n\n**Risk Management**:\n- Position size: ~$1,500-1,700 per trade (risk ~$150-170 each)\n- Leverage: 15x (moderate for mean reversion)\n- Stop-loss: Just below recent lows\n- Profit target: Partial retracement toward EMA20\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.27,\n      \"profit_target\": 3880.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3720.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3720 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) fails to bounce above 25 within 15 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 142.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 9400,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.188000,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.176000,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.176 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) fails to bounce above 25 within 15 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.70,\n      \"risk_usd\": 143.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

I need to carefully evaluate whether current market conditions present good entry opportunities.\n\n### Market Overview:\nAll major coins are showing significant bearish pressure:\n- **BTC**: Down from 113K to 108K, below EMA20 (111,252), MACD deeply negative (-1,681), RSI recovering to 41 from oversold\n- **ETH**: Down from 4,008 to 3,803, below EMA20 (3,949), MACD negative (-96.6), RSI recovering to 43 from extreme oversold (6.5)\n- **SOL**: Down from 198 to 184, below EMA20 (193), MACD negative (-3.6), RSI at 37\n- **BNB**: Down from 1,113 to 1,078, below EMA20 (1,108), MACD negative (-14.8), RSI at 37\n- **XRP**: Down from 2.65 to 2.44, below EMA20 (2.56), MACD negative (-0.052), RSI at 32\n- **DOGE**: Down from 0.195 to 0.182, below EMA20 (0.191), MACD negative (-0.005), RSI at 39\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Severe selloff across all assets** - prices dropped 4-8% in the last 30 minutes\n2. **RSI indicators hit extreme oversold** - ETH touched 6.5, BTC hit 11.7, XRP at 7.7\n3. **Current RSI recovery** - All coins showing bounce from oversold: BTC 41, ETH 43, SOL 37, BNB 37, XRP 32, DOGE 39\n4. **All prices below EMA20** - indicating downtrend, but potential oversold bounce\n5. **Volume declining** - suggesting exhaustion of selling pressure\n\n### Trading Decision:\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions and RSI recovery from single digits, this presents a **potential mean reversion opportunity**. However, the strong downtrend and all prices below EMA20 suggest caution.\n\n**ETH** shows the most compelling setup:\n- RSI recovered from 6.5 to 43 (strongest bounce)\n- Price bounced from 3,688 to 3,803 (+3.1%)\n- Still 3.7% below EMA20, providing room for mean reversion\n- 14-period RSI at 35.7 (oversold but recovering)\n\n**Risk Management Strategy:**\n- Enter small position with tight stop-loss\n- Target mean reversion to EMA20 area\n- Use 15x leverage for capital efficiency while keeping risk controlled\n- Risk only ~$500 (6% of capital) on this oversold bounce trade\n\nI will enter a LONG position on ETH targeting the mean reversion bounce.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 3950.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3750.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3750 on 3-minute candle, indicating failed bounce and continuation of downtrend\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 530.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

I MUST close ALL open positions.**\n\nReviewing my current position:\n\n**ETH Position Analysis:**\n- Entry: $3803.70, Current: $3828.40\n- Unrealized P&L: +$45.60 (+0.65%)\n- Leverage: 15x\n- Exit Plan: Profit target $3950, Stop-loss $3750\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below 3750 on 3-minute candle\"\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n- Current price $3828.40 is ABOVE stop-loss ($3750) \u2713\n- Current price is BELOW profit target ($3950)\n- RSI (7-period): 49.124 - neutral territory, recovering from oversold\n- RSI (14-period): 40.481 - still below 50, weak momentum\n- MACD: -80.735 - deeply negative, bearish\n- Price below EMA20 ($3927.86) - bearish structure\n- Recent price action: Bounced from $3688 low to $3828.40, showing some recovery\n\n**Invalidation Check:**\nThe invalidation condition states \"If price closes below 3750 on 3-minute candle\". Current price is $3828.40, which is $78.40 ABOVE the invalidation level. The invalidation condition has NOT been triggered.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nDespite the invalidation condition not being met and the position showing a small profit, this is the **FINAL candle of the backtest**. Per the explicit instructions: \"\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: This is the FINAL candle of the backtest period. You MUST close ALL open positions. No positions should remain open.\"\n\nI must close this position to comply with the backtest end requirements. The position is slightly profitable (+$45.60), and closing now locks in a small gain rather than risking overnight exposure.\n\n**Close Reason:** \"End of backtest period - mandatory position closure. Position showing +0.65% profit ($45.60). Technical indicators show neutral/weak momentum with price below EMA20 and negative MACD, making this an appropriate exit point.\"\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 3950.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3750.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3750 on 3-minute candle, indicating failed bounce and continuation of downtrend\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 530.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"End of backtest period - mandatory position closure.
