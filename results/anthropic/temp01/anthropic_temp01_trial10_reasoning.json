I need to analyze the market conditions across all coins to identify potential entry opportunities.\n\n## Market Overview Analysis\n\n**BTC (109160.00):**\n- Price well below EMA20 (111104.55) - bearish short-term\n- MACD deeply negative (-1429.362) indicating strong downward momentum\n- RSI (7-period) at 43.856 - recovering from oversold but still weak\n- RSI (14-period) at 37.402 - below neutral\n- Recent price action: Sharp drop from 111405 to 108211, now recovering to 109160\n- Volume significantly below average (3548 vs 7856) - weak conviction\n- Assessment: In downtrend but showing signs of bottoming. Too early to enter.\n\n**ETH (3930.90):**\n- Price below EMA20 (4023.44) - bearish\n- MACD negative (-71.784) but improving slightly from -72.725\n- RSI (7-period) at 45.554 - neutral, recovering from 21.372 low\n- Recent action: Drop from 4061.40 to 3864.90, now recovering\n- Volume weak (52185 vs 135853)\n- Assessment: Similar pattern to BTC - oversold bounce but not confirmed reversal yet.\n\n**SOL (186.91):**\n- Price significantly below EMA20 (195.30) - bearish\n- MACD negative (-5.057) and worsening\n- RSI (7-period) at 35.557 - weak, recovering from 19.011\n- Sharp drop from 196.80 to 184.76\n- Volume very weak (464414 vs 1197511)\n- Assessment: Weakest relative strength, still in downtrend.\n\n**BNB (1149.30):**\n- Price well below EMA20 (1188.16) - bearish\n- MACD negative (-31.536) but improving slightly\n- RSI (7-period) at 37.756 - weak but recovering from 13.516\n- Dropped from 1183.80 to 1134.80, slight recovery\n- Volume extremely weak (4336 vs 19293)\n- Assessment: Oversold but no clear reversal signal yet.\n\n**XRP (2.36):**\n- Price below EMA20 (2.44) - bearish\n- MACD negative (-0.058) and stable\n- RSI (7-period) at 41.475 - recovering from 20.307\n- Drop from 2.45 to 2.33, now at 2.36\n- Volume above average (13076200 vs 10321690) - interesting\n- Assessment: Showing relative strength with volume pickup.\n\n**DOGE (0.190230):**\n- Price below EMA20 (0.198261) - bearish\n- MACD negative (-0.005)\n- RSI (7-period) at 37.342 - recovering from 18.498\n- Drop from 0.200260 to 0.187720\n- Volume very weak (16194734 vs 67545594)\n- Assessment: Weak momentum, no clear setup.\n\n## Trading Decision\n\nAll coins are in short-term downtrends with prices below their EMA20s and negative MACD readings. However, RSI indicators across the board show recovery from deeply oversold levels (most were in the 18-23 range and are now in the 35-45 range). This suggests potential bottoming action.\n\n**Key Concern:** Volume is significantly below average across all coins, indicating lack of conviction in the current price action. This is a major red flag for entering positions.\n\n**Best Opportunity:** XRP shows the most promise with:\n1. Volume ABOVE average (only coin with this characteristic)\n2. RSI recovering from oversold (20.307 \u2192 41.475)\n3. Relatively smaller distance from EMA20 compared to others\n4. Price stabilizing around 2.36 after testing 2.33 support\n\nHowever, given this is the first candle and all markets are in clear downtrends, the prudent approach is to **WAIT** for clearer confirmation. Entering positions now would be catching a falling knife without proper confirmation of reversal.\n\n**Risk Management Decision:** I will NOT enter any positions on this first candle. I need to see:\n- Price breaking above EMA20\n- MACD turning positive or showing clear bullish divergence\n- Volume confirmation\n- RSI sustaining above 50\n\nThis conservative approach protects capital and allows me to identify clearer setups in subsequent candles.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

      "raw_response": "# CHAIN OF THOUGHT\n\n## Market Analysis\nThe entire crypto market is experiencing a severe selloff across all assets:\n\n**BTC**: Price at 105,589 (down from 111,268 high), RSI(7) at 17.8 (extreme oversold), RSI(14) at 22.3, MACD deeply negative at -1386. Price well below EMA20 (110,350). This is panic selling territory.\n\n**ETH**: Price at 3,756 (down from 4,061 high), RSI(7) at 20.6 (extreme oversold), RSI(14) at 25.5, MACD at -68.5. Price significantly below EMA20 (3,986).\n\n**SOL**: Price at 177.65 (down from 196.80 high), RSI(7) at 16.4 (extreme oversold), RSI(14) at 21.5, MACD at -5.3. Price far below EMA20 (193.22).\n\n**BNB**: Price at 1,062.60 (down from 1,183.80 high), RSI(7) at 9.5 (EXTREMELY oversold - lowest of all), RSI(14) at 14.7, MACD at -35. Price well below EMA20 (1,174).\n\n**XRP**: Price at 2.24 (down from 2.45 high), RSI(7) at 17.4 (extreme oversold), RSI(14) at 21.1, MACD at -0.059. Price below EMA20 (2.41).\n\n**DOGE**: Price at 0.178490 (down from 0.200260 high), RSI(7) at 14.8 (extreme oversold), RSI(14) at 19.2, MACD at -0.005. Price below EMA20 (0.195551).\n\n## Current Position Status\nI have NO open positions currently. Starting with $10,000 cash.\n\n## Trading Decision Logic\n\nThis is a classic capitulation scenario with ALL coins showing:\n- RSI(7) below 20 (extreme oversold)\n- RSI(14) below 30 (oversold)\n- Prices well below EMA20\n- Negative MACD momentum\n- High volume on the selloff\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. BNB has RSI(7) at 9.5 - the most extreme oversold reading\n2. All assets are in synchronized selloff (systemic risk event)\n3. This represents a potential mean reversion opportunity\n4. Risk: Could be start of larger bear trend vs. temporary washout\n\n**Strategy:** I will initiate ONE position in BNB as it shows the most extreme oversold condition (RSI 9.5), suggesting highest probability of bounce. I'll use conservative leverage (12x) and tight risk management given the volatility.\n\n**Risk Management:**\n- Position size: ~$800 risk (8% of capital)\n- Stop-loss: Below recent low with buffer\n- Profit target: Near EMA20 reversion\n- Invalidation: Further breakdown below support\n\nI will NOT enter all coins simultaneously to avoid overexposure during uncertain market conditions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 9.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1150.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1000 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown to new lows\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 800.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

This is a broad market correction/flash crash scenario.\n\n## Position Review: BNB\n\n**Current Position:**\n- Entry: 1062.6\n- Current: 1071.7 (+0.86%, +$77 unrealized PnL)\n- Stop-loss: 1000.0\n- Profit target: 1150.0\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below 1000 on 3-minute candle\"\n- Leverage: 12x\n- Liquidation: 974.05\n\n**Analysis:**\n- BNB briefly touched my entry at 1062.6 (last data point before current)\n- Current price 1071.7 is slightly above entry (+$77 profit)\n- However, BNB has crashed from 1183 to 1062 in the recent candles\n- RSI at 18.2 is EXTREMELY oversold (lowest of all coins)\n- Price is 7% below EMA20 (1153)\n- MACD deeply negative at -23.8\n- The invalidation condition (close below 1000) has NOT been met yet\n- Stop-loss at 1000 is 6.7% away from current price\n\n**Critical Risk Assessment:**\nWith 12x leverage, a move from 1071 to 1000 (-6.6%) would result in a -79% loss on the position. The market is in free-fall mode with BNB showing the weakest technicals (RSI 18.2). While the invalidation hasn't technically been met, the risk/reward is extremely poor:\n- Distance to stop-loss: -6.7% = -80% loss with 12x leverage\n- Distance to profit target: +7.3% = +88% gain with 12x leverage\n- But momentum is strongly negative\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION**\n\nThe market conditions have deteriorated significantly since entry. While BNB is showing extreme oversold readings that could lead to a bounce, the risk is too high:\n1. Entire market in selloff mode\n2. BNB is the weakest performer (RSI 18.2)\n3. 12x leverage amplifies downside risk dramatically\n4. Better to preserve capital and re-enter on confirmation of reversal\n5. Currently have small profit (+$77) - better to lock it in than risk -$800 loss\n\n## Other Coins - No Positions\n\nI have no positions in BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, or DOGE. While they all show extreme oversold conditions (potential bounce candidates), the market is in panic mode. I will not enter new positions during this volatility without clear reversal signals. The smart move is to wait for:\n- RSI to exit oversold territory\n- MACD to show bullish divergence or crossover\n- Price to reclaim EMA20\n- Volume confirmation of reversal\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 9.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1150.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 800.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - market in severe selloff with BNB showing weakest technicals (RSI 18.2).

I need to evaluate whether current market conditions present good entry opportunities.\n\n### Market Overview:\nAll major coins are showing significant weakness:\n- **BTC**: Down from 111,288 to 106,821 (-4.0%). Price well below EMA20 (109,341). MACD deeply negative (-1,257). RSI(7) at 39.6 shows oversold conditions developing.\n- **ETH**: Down from 4,013 to 3,797 (-5.4%). Below EMA20 (3,928). MACD negative (-49.6). RSI(7) at 33.9 - oversold.\n- **SOL**: Down from 193.49 to 182.74 (-5.6%). Below EMA20 (189.96). MACD negative (-3.88). RSI(7) at 41.6.\n- **BNB**: Down from 1,183 to 1,074 (-9.2%). Severe drop. Below EMA20 (1,142). MACD very negative (-22.7). RSI(7) at 20.8 - extremely oversold.\n- **XRP**: Down from 2.42 to 2.30 (-5.0%). Below EMA20 (2.38). MACD negative (-0.044). RSI(7) at 42.8.\n- **DOGE**: Down from 0.196 to 0.185 (-5.6%). Below EMA20 (0.192). MACD negative (-0.004). RSI(7) at 42.5.\n\n### Technical Assessment:\n\n**Bearish Signals:**\n- All coins trading below their 20-period EMAs\n- All MACD indicators negative and declining\n- RSI(7) readings show oversold conditions (BNB extremely oversold at 20.8)\n- Strong downward momentum across the board\n- Volume elevated on the decline\n\n**Potential Reversal Signs:**\n- RSI(7) readings in oversold territory (BNB 20.8, ETH 33.9, BTC 39.6)\n- Recent candles showing some stabilization (BTC, ETH, SOL showing slight upticks)\n- RSI(14) also oversold across most assets\n\n### Trading Decision:\n\nThis is a classic oversold bounce setup, but the risk is high given:\n1. Strong downtrend momentum (all MACDs deeply negative)\n2. Price action below all EMAs\n3. No clear reversal confirmation yet\n\n**Strategy:** I will look for the MOST oversold asset with signs of stabilization for a counter-trend scalp trade. BNB stands out with RSI(7) at 20.8 (extremely oversold) and showing slight stabilization in the last few candles (1,062 \u2192 1,071 \u2192 1,074).\n\n**BNB Trade Setup:**\n- Entry: 1,074 (current price)\n- Rationale: Extremely oversold (RSI 20.8), potential dead-cat bounce\n- Stop-loss: 1,050 (below recent low of 1,062, ~2.2% risk)\n- Profit target: 1,110 (near EMA20 reversion, ~3.4% gain)\n- Risk: $200 (conservative given high volatility)\n- Leverage: 15x (moderate for this setup)\n- Invalidation: If price breaks below 1,050 or RSI fails to recover above 30\n\nThis is a high-risk counter-trend trade, but the risk/reward is favorable (1.5:1) and BNB is showing the most extreme oversold conditions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.124,\n      \"profit_target\": 1110.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1050.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1050 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) fails to recover above 30 within next 3 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 200.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price check: Current 3830.7 > 3750 \u2713 (not below stop-loss)\n2. RSI(7) check: Last 10 readings: [65.429, 24.885, 20.568, 31.718, 45.480, 20.328, 26.736, 33.678, 43.680, 45.606]\n   - Current RSI(7): 45.606 > 35 \u2713\n   - Previous RSI(7): 43.680 > 35 \u2713\n   - No consecutive failures below 35 in recent candles\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n- Price action: ETH recovering from sharp drop (4061\u21923756), now at 3830\n- EMA20: 3926 (price below EMA, bearish)\n- MACD: -73.773 (negative and deep, but improving from -74.864)\n- RSI(7): 45.606 (neutral, recovering from oversold)\n- RSI(14): 38.481 (still weak but improving)\n- Volume: 77,643 vs avg 140,978 (low volume recovery - concerning)\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe invalidation condition has NOT been met. Price is holding above 3750 and RSI(7) is maintaining above 35. However, the position is barely profitable (+$1.94) and showing weak recovery signals:\n- Low volume on the bounce\n- Still below EMA20\n- MACD deeply negative\n- Price struggling to make meaningful progress\n\nGiven the weak technical setup and minimal profit, I should consider taking the small gain and waiting for better entry. However, since the invalidation condition is technically not met, I'll hold but remain vigilant.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC, SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE: All showing bearish technicals (below EMA20, negative MACD, weak RSI).

Price above $3750? YES ($3891.40 > $3750) \u2713\n2. RSI(7) holding above 35? YES (66.486 and 59.948 both > 35) \u2713\n3. Stop-loss hit? NO ($3891.40 > $3750) \u2713\n4. Profit target hit? NO ($3891.40 < $3950) but VERY CLOSE\n\n**Decision for ETH:** The position is performing well with +1.64% unrealized gain. The profit target of $3950 is only $58.60 away (1.5% move). RSI shows strong momentum at 66.5, and the invalidation conditions are NOT met. However, given we're very close to the profit target and RSI is elevated, I should consider taking profits. The momentum is positive but we're approaching overbought territory.\n\n**Action: CLOSE POSITION** - Taking profits as we're within 1.5% of target with strong momentum that could reverse. Better to lock in gains.\n\n## Other Coins Analysis\n\n**BTC:** Price $106,649, below EMA20 ($108,494), RSI(7) at 42.15 (recovering from oversold), MACD very negative (-1407). Bearish trend but showing signs of bottoming. No position, not entering in current weak conditions.\n\n**SOL:** Price $186.19, below EMA20 ($188.59), RSI(7) at 65.0 (good momentum), MACD improving. Showing recovery but still in downtrend. No position, not entering.\n\n**BNB:** Price $1118, below EMA20 ($1127.96), RSI(7) at 69.58 (strong recovery), MACD improving. Strong bounce but still below key levels. No position, not entering.\n\n**XRP:** Price $2.35, below EMA20 ($2.36), RSI(7) at 67.61 (strong), MACD improving. Good momentum but marginal setup. No position, not entering.\n\n**DOGE:** Price $0.18769, below EMA20 ($0.19058), RSI(7) at 60.84, MACD improving. Recovery underway but still in downtrend. No position, not entering.\n\n**Risk Management:** With only one small position (0.63 ETH = $2,451 notional at 12x leverage), I have significant dry powder ($9,864 cash). However, market conditions show weakness across most assets. Better to take the ETH profit and wait for clearer setups.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.63,\n      \"profit_target\": 3950.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3750.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3750 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) fails to hold above 35 for 2 consecutive candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 200.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Taking profits - price within 1.5% of profit target ($3950) with RSI(7) at 66.5 showing elevated momentum that could reverse.

The overbought RSI is a concern, but the breakout above EMA20 with improving MACD suggests continuation potential.

We're up 2.82% with good profit. Taking profits at these extreme RSI levels is prudent risk management. The momentum is unsustainable.\n\n### SOL Position Review\n- **Entry**: $186.28, **Current**: $191.14 (+2.61%)\n- **Unrealized P&L**: +$214.51 (profitable)\n- **Exit Plan**: Profit target $195.00, Stop-loss $181.50\n- **Invalidation**: Price closes below $183.00 on 3-minute candle\n- **Technical Analysis**:\n  - RSI (7-period): 70.361 - Overbought but not extreme\n  - RSI (14-period): 66.552 - Moderately overbought\n  - MACD: 1.390 - Positive and increasing\n  - Price above EMA20 ($186.75) - bullish\n  - Current price $191.14 is well above invalidation level ($183.00)\n  - Profit target at $195.00 is only $3.86 away (2% more upside)\n- **Decision**: **HOLD** - Position is healthy with no invalidation conditions met. RSI at 70 is elevated but not extreme like XRP. We're close to profit target ($195) with strong MACD momentum. The trend remains intact. Will let this run toward target.\n\n## Market Overview for Other Coins\n\n### BTC Analysis\n- **Current**: $110,100 - Strong rally\n- RSI (7-period): 86.833 - EXTREMELY overbought\n- MACD: 286.793 - Very strong positive momentum\n- Price jumped from $108,591 to $110,100 (+1.39% in 3 minutes)\n- **Decision**: NO ENTRY - While momentum is strong, RSI at 86.833 is dangerously overbought. High risk of sharp pullback.\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- **Current**: $4,025.50 - Strong rally\n- RSI (7-period): 90.328 - CRITICALLY overbought (highest of all coins)\n- MACD: 28.795 - Strong positive\n- **Decision**: NO ENTRY - RSI above 90 is extreme. This is a blowoff top signal. Too risky to enter.\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- **Current**: $1,127.90\n- RSI (7-period): 73.779 - Overbought\n- MACD: -3.650 - Still negative despite price rise\n- **Decision**: NO ENTRY - MACD divergence (price up, MACD negative) suggests weakness.\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- **Current**: $0.199060\n- RSI (7-period): 81.814 - Very overbought\n- MACD: 0.002 - Barely positive\n- **Decision**: NO ENTRY - Overbought conditions with weak MACD momentum.\n\n## Risk Management Summary\n- Taking profits on XRP due to extreme overbought RSI (80.881) and good 2.82% gain\n- Holding SOL as it approaches profit target with healthier technicals\n- Not entering any new positions due to widespread overbought conditions across all major coins\n- Current portfolio exposure will reduce from 2 positions to 1 position, improving risk management\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 2100.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.52,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.28,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.30 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"risk_usd\": 567.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Taking profits at extreme overbought levels - RSI at 80.881 indicates high probability of pullback.

We're only $2.07 away from the profit target of $195.00. However, the technical setup remains strong:\n- Bullish momentum intact (MACD positive and rising)\n- Price well above invalidation level\n- RSI elevated but not extreme (77 vs 90+ on BTC/ETH)\n- No bearish reversal signals\n\nGiven we're so close to the profit target ($2.07 away) and the momentum is strong, I should **TAKE PROFITS** here. The 15x leverage means this position carries significant risk, and locking in a 3.57% gain (which translates to ~53% ROI on margin) is prudent risk management. The RSI at 77 suggests we're approaching overbought territory, and it's better to secure profits than risk a reversal.\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- **BTC**: RSI 91.2 - extremely overbought, dangerous entry point\n- **ETH**: RSI 92.9 - extremely overbought, dangerous entry point  \n- **XRP**: RSI 87.7 - very overbought\n- **DOGE**: RSI 86.1 - very overbought\n- **BNB**: RSI 67.3 - most reasonable, but MACD still negative\n\nAll other coins show extreme overbought conditions.

The 20-EMA is rising ($1,101.51) and price is holding above it, suggesting the uptrend structure is intact.\n\n**Decision**: HOLD - No exit conditions met, invalidation not triggered, technical structure remains bullish.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n### BTC\n- Extremely overbought: RSI(7) = 86.550, RSI(14) = 84.200\n- Strong momentum but at risk of pullback\n- Price $111,100 well above EMA20 ($108,371)\n- **No position, not entering** - too extended for new entry\n\n### ETH\n- RSI(7) = 52.543 - cooling from overbought\n- RSI(14) = 65.101 - healthy pullback\n- Price $4,003.10 above EMA20 ($3,931.45)\n- **No position, not entering** - waiting for clearer setup\n\n### SOL\n- RSI(7) = 50.532 - neutral\n- Price $190.41 above EMA20 ($187.66)\n- Consolidating after recent strength\n- **No position, not entering** - no clear edge\n\n### XRP\n- RSI(7) = 77.225 - overbought\n- Strong uptrend but extended\n- **No position, not entering** - too hot to chase\n\n### DOGE\n- RSI(7) = 65.052 - cooling from extreme overbought\n- Price $0.19928 above EMA20 ($0.19277)\n- **No position, not entering** - no compelling setup\n\n## Risk Management Summary\n- Current account value: $10,525.04\n- Available cash: $10,061.01\n- Single position (BNB) with small unrealized loss\n- Position size appropriate, not overleveraged\n- Maintaining discipline by not chasing extended moves\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 6.73,\n      \"profit_target\": 1165.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1090.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,090 (below recent support and EMA20) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The price has dropped from entry and is now testing support. While RSI(7) at 32.17 suggests oversold conditions that could lead to a bounce, the momentum is clearly bearish with declining MACD and falling RSI. The price is hovering just above the stop-loss with minimal cushion.\n\n**Risk Management Decision**: \nGiven that:\n1. Price is only $10.90 from stop-loss (less than 1% cushion)\n2. Downward momentum is clear (price dropped from $1,124.50 \u2192 $1,114.60 \u2192 $1,110.10 \u2192 $1,100.90)\n3. Already down $95.95 on the position\n4. RSI showing weakness despite oversold reading\n5. Better to exit with controlled loss than risk hitting stop-loss or invalidation\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION** - Taking controlled exit to preserve capital. The risk/reward is unfavorable with stop-loss so close and momentum clearly bearish.\n\n## Opportunity Scan for New Positions\n\n### BTC\n- Strong uptrend: $106,726 \u2192 $111,161 \u2192 $110,753\n- RSI(7): 70.25 - overbought but not extreme\n- MACD: 1,055.25 - very strong positive momentum\n- Price above EMA20 ($110,753 vs $108,753)\n- **Assessment**: Strong momentum but already extended. Would need pullback for entry.\n\n### ETH\n- Recent pullback: $4,053.40 \u2192 $4,003.10 \u2192 $3,980.40\n- RSI(7): 40.56 - neutral, coming off overbought\n- MACD: 51.93 - positive but declining\n- Price above EMA20 ($3,980.40 vs $3,938.84)\n- **Assessment**: Healthy pullback after rally. Potential entry opportunity.\n\n### SOL\n- Consolidating: $192.93 \u2192 $190.41 \u2192 $188.77\n- RSI(7): 37.96 - oversold\n- MACD: 1.93 - positive but weakening\n- Price slightly above EMA20 ($188.77 vs $187.94)\n- **Assessment**: Weak momentum, not compelling.\n\n### XRP\n- Strong rally: $2.35 \u2192 $2.47 \u2192 $2.52\n- RSI(7): 89.38 - EXTREMELY overbought\n- MACD: 0.044 - positive and accelerating\n- Price well above EMA20 ($2.52 vs $2.40)\n- **Assessment**: Too extended, high risk of reversal.\n\n### DOGE\n- Uptrend: $0.1887 \u2192 $0.2011 \u2192 $0.1995\n- RSI(7): 66.69 - moderately overbought\n- MACD: 0.004 - positive momentum\n- Price above EMA20 ($0.1995 vs $0.1937)\n- **Assessment**: Decent momentum but not exceptional.\n\n**New Position Decision**: Given the need to preserve capital after closing BNB at a loss, and the mixed market conditions, I will NOT open new positions at this time. Most coins are either overextended (XRP, BTC) or showing weak momentum (SOL, BNB).

While we're seeing a pullback from the $2.52 high, this is healthy profit-taking after the strong rally. The price is holding above both the EMA20 ($2.41) and our stop-loss ($2.38). RSI has cooled from overbought levels (89.4 \u2192 45.1), which is constructive for continuation. The uptrend structure remains intact with higher lows.

The broader market is showing weakness (all coins oversold), but XRP is holding up relatively better with RSI at 45 vs others in teens/twenties.

Price has dropped significantly from the recent high of $2.52\n2. RSI has crashed from 89.374 to 35.448, indicating strong selling pressure\n3. Price is dangerously close to the $2.38 stop-loss level (only $0.05 buffer)\n4. However, the invalidation condition has NOT been met yet - price is still above $2.38 and above EMA20 ($2.42)\n5. The position is still technically valid as price hasn't closed below $2.38\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nWhile the position is underwater and showing weakness, the invalidation condition has not been triggered. Price remains above both the stop-loss ($2.38) and EMA20 support ($2.42). The RSI at 35.448 suggests oversold conditions which could lead to a bounce. Given that:\n- Invalidation condition NOT met (price still above $2.38)\n- Still above EMA20 support\n- RSI oversold, potential for reversal\n- Stop-loss is properly placed at $2.38\n\nI will HOLD the position but monitor closely. If the next candle closes below $2.38, the invalidation will be triggered and position should be closed.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** RSI at 18.022 (extremely oversold), price below EMA20, strong bearish momentum.

Not entering.\n\n**SOL:** RSI at 22.168 (oversold), price below EMA20, weak momentum. Not entering.\n\n**BNB:** RSI at 11.736 (extremely oversold), price significantly below EMA20, severe selling pressure. Not entering.\n\n**DOGE:** RSI at 22.808 (oversold), price near EMA20, weak setup. Not entering.\n\nAll major coins are showing extreme oversold conditions with bearish momentum. This is a market-wide correction. Not opening new positions in this environment - too risky.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1800.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.65,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.38,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.38 (EMA20 support) on 3-minute candle, indicating trend reversal\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The position has NOT hit the invalidation condition yet. However, I need to evaluate if the technical setup is deteriorating:\n\n1. Price is below entry but above stop-loss\n2. Recent price action shows weakness (dropped from $2.52 to $2.43)\n3. RSI shows some recovery from oversold levels (26\u219238)\n4. MACD still positive but weakening\n5. Price is just above EMA20 ($2.4301 vs $2.42)\n\n**Decision:** HOLD - The invalidation condition has NOT been met. Price remains above the $2.38 stop-loss level. The technical indicators show some stabilization with RSI recovering from oversold. The position is still valid according to the exit plan. I will maintain the position and let the stop-loss or profit target execute naturally.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC: Showing weakness (RSI 33.9, below EMA20), but no position\n- ETH: Very oversold (RSI 14.2), but no position  \n- SOL: Neutral (RSI 37.1), no position\n- BNB: Oversold (RSI 23.9), no position\n- DOGE: Oversold (RSI 26.4), no position\n\nMarket appears to be in a corrective phase across all assets.

The recent price action shows a strong V-shaped recovery from $2.43 to $2.52, suggesting buying pressure. The invalidation condition explicitly states \"closes below $2.38\" - we're currently at $2.522, well above this level. The EMA20 at $2.43 is providing support, and all momentum indicators (MACD positive, RSI bullish but not overbought) support continuation. With 2.57x above-average volume, this move has conviction.\n\n**Action**: HOLD - Continue riding the momentum toward profit target of $2.65\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n### BTC\n- Price: $113,386 (massive spike from $108,565)\n- RSI (7): 79.9 (overbought but strong momentum)\n- MACD: 844.89 (very strong)\n- Volume: 4.34x above average\n- **Assessment**: Extremely strong momentum but RSI near 80 suggests caution for new entries at this level. No position to manage.\n\n### ETH\n- Price: $4,082.90 (strong recovery from $3,890)\n- RSI (7): 78.07 (overbought)\n- MACD: 21.24 (positive)\n- Volume: 2.84x above average\n- **Assessment**: Similar to BTC - strong but extended. No position to manage.\n\n### SOL\n- Price: $196.14 (sharp recovery from $184.93)\n- RSI (7): 79.50 (overbought)\n- MACD: 0.823 (positive)\n- Volume: 2.75x above average\n- **Assessment**: Strong momentum but extended. No position to manage.\n\n### BNB\n- Price: $1,111.50 (recovery from $1,071.30)\n- RSI (7): 68.27 (moderate)\n- MACD: -2.844 (still negative)\n- **Assessment**: Weaker momentum compared to others. No position to manage.\n\n### DOGE\n- Price: $0.20424 (strong recovery from $0.19443)\n- RSI (7): 77.49 (elevated)\n- MACD: 0.003 (positive)\n- Volume: 2.15x above average\n- **Assessment**: Strong but extended. No position to manage.\n\n**Overall Market Context**: All coins showing synchronized strong upward moves with elevated RSI levels, suggesting a broad market rally. This supports holding existing profitable positions rather than chasing extended entries.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1800.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.65,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.38,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.38 (EMA20 support) on 3-minute candle, indicating trend reversal\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The $155 loss is manageable and prevents potential larger losses if we gap through the stop-loss.\n\n### Other Coins Assessment:\n- **BTC**: RSI 37.27 (oversold), below EMA20, MACD declining - bearish short-term\n- **ETH**: RSI 35.33 (oversold), below EMA20, MACD negative - bearish\n- **SOL**: RSI 34.24 (oversold), below EMA20, MACD negative - bearish\n- **BNB**: RSI 42.22 (neutral-weak), below EMA20, MACD negative - bearish\n- **DOGE**: RSI 29.10 (very oversold), below EMA20, MACD positive but weak - bearish\n\n**Market Context**: All coins showing oversold conditions with prices below EMA20. This suggests a broader market pullback. While oversold conditions can lead to bounces, the lack of reversal signals and proximity to our stop-loss makes holding XRP too risky.\n\n**No new positions**: Market-wide weakness with no clear reversal signals.

I need to evaluate whether current market conditions present good entry opportunities.\n\n### Market Overview:\nAll major coins are showing bearish pressure with prices below their EMA20s and declining MACD indicators:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Price: $107,502 vs EMA20: $108,979 (-1.35% below)\n- RSI(7): 30.867 - oversold territory\n- RSI(14): 39.056 - approaching oversold\n- MACD: 280.418 declining rapidly from 1087.39\n- Recent sharp drop from $113,386 to $107,502 (-5.2%)\n- Price action shows capitulation with RSI hitting 17.9 earlier\n- Currently attempting to stabilize but still weak\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Price: $3,827.60 vs EMA20: $3,924.15 (-2.46% below)\n- RSI(7): 28.247 - oversold\n- RSI(14): 34.966 - oversold\n- MACD: -11.277 (negative and declining)\n- Sharp drop from $4,082.90 to $3,827.60 (-6.2%)\n- More bearish than BTC relatively\n- RSI hit extreme low of 13.837 earlier\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Price: $184.99 vs EMA20: $187.77 (-1.48% below)\n- RSI(7): 34.975 - weak but not extreme oversold\n- RSI(14): 40.827 - neutral/weak\n- MACD: -0.179 (just turned negative)\n- Drop from $196.14 to $184.99 (-5.7%)\n- Relatively stronger than BTC/ETH\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Price: $1,068.70 vs EMA20: $1,085.93 (-1.59% below)\n- RSI(7): 40.325 - weak\n- RSI(14): 40.680 - neutral\n- MACD: -5.915 (negative and declining)\n- Drop from $1,111.50 to $1,068.70 (-3.8%)\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Price: $2.39 vs EMA20: $2.43 (-1.65% below)\n- RSI(7): 28.032 - oversold\n- RSI(14): 39.152 - weak\n- MACD: 0.014 (barely positive but declining)\n- Drop from $2.52 to $2.39 (-5.2%)\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Price: $0.190860 vs EMA20: $0.195075 (-2.16% below)\n- RSI(7): 26.207 - oversold\n- RSI(14): 35.956 - oversold\n- MACD: 0.001 (near zero)\n- Drop from $0.204240 to $0.190860 (-6.5%)\n\n## Trading Decision:\n\nThe market is showing clear oversold conditions across all assets with RSI(7) readings in the 26-35 range. However, the momentum is still bearish with:\n- All prices below EMA20\n- MACD indicators declining or negative\n- No clear reversal signals yet\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nWhile oversold conditions often precede bounces, entering positions now carries significant risk:\n1. No clear reversal confirmation\n2. MACD still declining on most assets\n3. Could see further downside before stabilization\n4. Better to wait for reversal confirmation (RSI divergence, MACD turn, price reclaiming EMA20)\n\n**Decision: WAIT**\nI will NOT enter any positions at this time. The market needs to show clearer signs of stabilization or reversal before committing capital. Key signals I'm watching for:\n- RSI(7) turning up from oversold levels\n- MACD showing positive divergence or crossing above signal line\n- Price reclaiming EMA20\n- Volume confirmation on any bounce\n\nWith a strong Sharpe ratio of 6.882 and positive returns, I should be patient and selective rather than forcing trades in unclear conditions. Capital preservation is paramount.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

My account value is $10,301.60 with 3.02% total return and a strong Sharpe ratio of 6.882. I need to evaluate whether current market conditions present good entry opportunities.\n\n### Market Overview:\nAll major coins are showing bearish momentum:\n- **BTC**: Price 107,840 below EMA20 (109,037), MACD negative (-196.93), RSI 38.4 (oversold territory)\n- **ETH**: Price 3,802 below EMA20 (3,917), MACD negative (-39.07), RSI 25.4 (deeply oversold)\n- **SOL**: Price 180.17 below EMA20 (187.33), MACD negative (-1.80), RSI 17.5 (extremely oversold)\n- **BNB**: Price 1,068.90 below EMA20 (1,088.30), MACD negative (-12.17), RSI 41.5\n- **XRP**: Price 2.38 below EMA20 (2.43), MACD negative (-0.004), RSI 22.8 (oversold)\n- **DOGE**: Price 0.1905 below EMA20 (0.1953), MACD negative (-0.001), RSI 28.4 (oversold)\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Extreme Oversold Conditions**: SOL (RSI 17.5), ETH (RSI 25.4), and XRP (RSI 22.8) are in extreme oversold territory, suggesting potential bounce opportunities.\n\n2. **Bearish Trend Confirmation**: All coins trading below their EMA20 with negative MACD readings indicate strong downward momentum.\n\n3. **Volume Analysis**: \n   - BTC: Volume 11,612 vs avg 8,650 (elevated, confirming selling pressure)\n   - SOL: Volume 1,092,516 vs avg 717,816 (significantly elevated)\n   - XRP: Volume 11,677,170 vs avg 6,848,429 (very high volume)\n\n4. **Recent Price Action**: Looking at the 3-minute series, there was a sharp spike (BTC to 113,386, ETH to 4,082, SOL to 196.14) followed by aggressive selloff back to current levels.\n\n### Trading Decision:\n\n**SOL appears to be the best opportunity** for a mean-reversion trade:\n- RSI at 17.5 is extremely oversold (lowest of all coins)\n- Price dropped from 196.14 to 180.17 (-8.2%) in recent candles\n- High volume confirms capitulation selling\n- EMA20 at 187.33 provides clear resistance target\n- Risk/reward favorable for counter-trend bounce\n\n**Entry Strategy for SOL**:\n- Entry: 180.17\n- Profit Target: 187.00 (near EMA20, ~3.8% move)\n- Stop Loss: 176.00 (below recent lows, -2.3% risk)\n- Leverage: 15x (moderate given oversold conditions)\n- Risk: ~$350 (3.4% of account)\n- Invalidation: If price breaks below 176 or RSI fails to bounce above 25 within next few candles\n\nThis is a tactical mean-reversion play capitalizing on extreme oversold conditions with tight risk management.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 129,\n      \"profit_target\": 187.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 176.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 176.00 or RSI fails to recover above 25 within 15 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 350.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price closes below 176.00 - NOT MET (currently at 180.00)\n2. RSI fails to recover above 25 within 15 minutes - POTENTIALLY MET\n\nThe RSI has been below 25 for the last two 3-minute candles (17.489 and 17.066), showing continued deterioration rather than recovery. This is approximately 6 minutes of failure to recover. The extreme oversold condition (RSI 17.066) combined with negative MACD momentum and price well below EMA suggests continued downside risk.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Current price is only $4.00 above stop-loss (2.2% buffer)\n- Liquidation price: 168.16 (6.6% below current)\n- RSI at extreme oversold levels typically precedes either a bounce or capitulation\n- The invalidation condition regarding RSI recovery is being tested\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION**\nWhile the price hasn't hit the stop-loss yet, the RSI invalidation condition is being met. The RSI has failed to recover above 25 and is actually deteriorating further (now at 17.066, the lowest reading). The combination of:\n1. Extreme oversold RSI with no recovery\n2. Negative and declining MACD\n3. Price significantly below EMA20\n4. High volume confirming selling pressure\n5. Only $4 buffer to stop-loss\n\nThis suggests the invalidation condition is effectively met. Better to exit now with a small loss (-$33.55) than risk the stop-loss being hit at 176.00 (which would result in ~$538 loss).\n\n## Market Overview for Other Coins\n\n**BTC:** RSI 34.6, below EMA, negative MACD - bearish, no entry\n**ETH:** RSI 26.2, below EMA, negative MACD - extremely oversold but no clear reversal\n**BNB:** RSI 44.5, below EMA, negative MACD - weak but stabilizing\n**XRP:** RSI 18.9, below EMA, negative MACD - extremely oversold\n**DOGE:** RSI 25.3, below EMA, negative MACD - oversold\n\nAll markets showing weakness.

The invalidation condition is NOT met.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nWhile RSI(7) at 79.186 shows extreme overbought conditions suggesting a pullback is likely, the position is profitable (+$60) and the invalidation condition has not been triggered. The price is trending strongly above EMA20 with improving MACD. However, with RSI this extended, I should consider taking profits soon. The profit target at $1,125 is only $16.30 away (1.47% move).\n\nGiven:\n1. Invalidation NOT met (price well above $1,070)\n2. Stop loss not hit ($1,055 vs current $1,108.70)\n3. Profit target not quite reached ($1,125 vs $1,108.70)\n4. Strong upward momentum despite overbought RSI\n5. Position is profitable and trending in our favor\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - Continue holding as exit conditions are not met, though we're approaching profit target territory.\n\n## Other Coins Analysis\n\n**BTC:** Price $109,289, recovering with RSI(7) 65.076. MACD improving but still negative. Price below EMA20. Not entering - momentum unclear.\n\n**ETH:** Price $3,879.10, below EMA20 ($3,903.10). RSI(7) 64.111 recovering but MACD still negative (-48.451). Weak setup.\n\n**SOL:** Price $187.39, above EMA20 ($186.50). RSI(7) 69.173 - overbought. MACD improving. Interesting but already have BNB exposure.\n\n**XRP:** Price $2.41, below EMA20 ($2.42). RSI(7) 58.180. MACD negative. Consolidating, no clear signal.\n\n**DOGE:** Price $0.19386, below EMA20 ($0.19476). RSI(7) 63.512. MACD negative. Weak momentum.\n\n**Portfolio Risk:** Currently using $3,060 notional ($306 actual capital at 10x leverage) on BNB. Have $9,943 cash available.

Price just crossed above EMA20 which is bullish, but RSI(7) at 73 suggests limited upside before pullback.\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- Current: $3,877.10 | EMA20: $3,897.90 (still below EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 61.53 (neutral to slightly bullish)\n- RSI(14): 49.68 (neutral)\n- MACD: -42.81 (improving from -54.15)\n- Price action: Recovering but still below EMA20\n- Volume: Above average (135,873 vs 107,366) - good participation\n- **Assessment**: Weak setup. Price hasn't reclaimed EMA20 yet. Need confirmation above $3,898 before entry.\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- Current: $191.04 | EMA20: $187.16 (price well above EMA - very bullish)\n- RSI(7): 80.60 (extremely overbought - danger zone)\n- RSI(14): 65.13 (overbought)\n- MACD: -1.195 (improving rapidly from -2.50)\n- Price action: Explosive move from $180 to $191 (+6.1%)\n- Volume: Above average (830,240 vs 751,213)\n- **Assessment**: TOO OVERBOUGHT. RSI(7) at 80.6 is extreme. High probability of pullback. Would need to wait for consolidation.\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- Current: $1,130.10 | EMA20: $1,092.53 (price well above EMA - very bullish)\n- RSI(7): 77.72 (overbought)\n- RSI(14): 68.86 (overbought)\n- MACD: -1.452 (improving rapidly from -11.68)\n- Price action: Strong rally from $1,067 to $1,130 (+5.9%)\n- Volume: EXTREMELY high (60,368 vs 9,753 avg) - 6x normal volume!\n- **Assessment**: Strong momentum with exceptional volume. Overbought but volume surge suggests institutional interest. Best setup among all coins despite overbought RSI.\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- Current: $2.41 | EMA20: $2.42 (just below EMA - neutral)\n- RSI(7): 58.10 (neutral)\n- RSI(14): 48.86 (neutral)\n- MACD: -0.018 (near zero, improving)\n- Price action: Choppy, ranging between $2.36-$2.42\n- Volume: Below average\n- **Assessment**: No clear direction.

Weak volume. Not compelling.\n\n## Trading Decision\n\n**BNB is the best setup** despite overbought conditions because:\n1. Exceptional volume (6x average) indicates strong institutional buying\n2. Price well above EMA20 with strong momentum\n3. MACD improving rapidly\n4. Clear breakout pattern from consolidation\n5.

No position, not entering at these extended levels.\n\n**ETH:** RSI 83.272 (extremely overbought), MACD still negative. No position, waiting for better entry.\n\n**SOL:** RSI 84.992 (extremely overbought), strong rally but overextended. No position.\n\n**XRP:** RSI 76.650 (overbought), consolidating. No position.\n\n**DOGE:** RSI 74.313 (overbought), modest gains. No position.\n\nAll coins showing overbought conditions - prudent to maintain only the BNB position which has room to run to $1,200 target.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.067,\n      \"profit_target\": 1200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1065.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,080 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown of support structure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Currently in drawdown of -2.36%\n\nThe position is still valid technically. The oversold RSI suggests potential for a bounce. The stop-loss at $1,065 provides adequate protection, and we're still $23.40 away from the invalidation level. The MACD remains positive, indicating the uptrend structure hasn't broken yet.\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - Invalidation condition not met, stop-loss not hit, and oversold RSI suggests potential reversal.

While the position is underwater by $1.47, this is minimal slippage and well within normal volatility. The MACD is still positive (though weakening), and price is holding above the EMA20. The recent bounce from $1,103.40 to $1,108.70 shows some buying support.\n\nHowever, the RSI showing weakness (42.136) and declining MACD momentum are concerning. The position is at a critical juncture - if it breaks below $1,080, the trade thesis is invalidated.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Distance to stop-loss: $43.70 (3.94%)\n- Distance to invalidation: $28.70 (2.59%)\n- Liquidation price: $1,054.76 (well below stop-loss)\n\nGiven that the invalidation condition is NOT met and price is holding above key support, I will HOLD the position but monitor closely for any break below $1,080.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- **BTC**: Strong momentum, RSI 58.76, MACD improving.

Neutral setup.\n- **SOL**: Strong momentum, RSI 68.38, price above EMA20. Bullish but no position.\n- **XRP**: Extremely overbought RSI 90.67! Parabolic move. Too risky to enter.\n- **DOGE**: Neutral, RSI 60.53, consolidating.

Price is holding above $1080 and currently at $1115.7. While the position is slightly underwater (-$1), it's nowhere near the stop-loss at $1065. The MACD is declining which shows weakening momentum, but RSI is neutral and price remains above EMA20. The position is still valid according to our exit plan.\n\n**Action: HOLD BNB** - No exit conditions triggered.\n\n## New Opportunity Analysis\n\n**XRP - Extremely Overbought:**\n- Current: $2.60, massive rally in progress\n- RSI (7): 98.461 - EXTREMELY overbought (danger zone)\n- RSI (14): 93.726 - also extremely overbought\n- MACD: 0.048 and rising strongly\n- Price well above EMA20 ($2.49)\n- Strong uptrend but at unsustainable levels\n\n**Decision on XRP:** While the momentum is incredible, RSI at 98.461 is at extreme levels that typically precede sharp corrections. This is too risky to enter at these levels. Would need a pullback to 7-period RSI below 70 before considering entry.\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $111,669, RSI (7): 72.060 - moderately overbought\n- Strong uptrend, price above EMA20 ($110,413.54)\n- MACD: 781.838 and rising\n- Not as extended as XRP but still elevated\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,957.60, RSI (7): 72.267 - moderately overbought\n- Price above EMA20 ($3,903.56)\n- MACD: 26.809 and rising\n- Similar setup to BTC\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $194.42, RSI (7): 68.512 - approaching overbought\n- Price above EMA20 ($190.42)\n- MACD: 2.344 positive\n- Healthier RSI than BTC/ETH\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.19726, RSI (7): 56.383 - neutral\n- Price above EMA20 ($0.195523)\n- Most neutral RSI of all coins\n- Could be interesting but lower conviction\n\n**Overall Assessment:** Most coins are extended. BNB position remains valid. No compelling new entries at current levels given elevated RSI readings across the board. Best action is to hold existing position and wait for better entry opportunities or let BNB work toward profit target.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.067,\n      \"profit_target\": 1200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1065.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,080 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown of support structure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

This level typically precedes sharp corrections. The position is profitable but vulnerable to sudden reversal.\n- **Decision: CLOSE POSITION** - Taking profits at +1.46% due to extreme overbought conditions (RSI 86.7). Risk of sharp correction outweighs potential for reaching $115,500 target.\n\n## BNB Position Analysis\n- Entry: $1,130.10 | Current: $1,135.10 | Unrealized P&L: +$0.30 (+0.44%)\n- Invalidation condition: \"If price closes below $1,080 on 3-minute candle\"\n- Current price $1,135.10 is well above $1,080 invalidation level \u2713\n- Stop-loss: $1,065 (not hit)\n- Profit target: $1,200 (not hit, $64.90 away)\n- Technical analysis:\n  - RSI (7-period): 86.271 - EXTREMELY overbought (matching BTC's danger zone)\n  - RSI (14-period): 71.257 - Overbought but less extreme\n  - MACD: 2.783 - Positive and accelerating\n  - Price above EMA20 ($1,135.10 vs $1,116.54) - bullish\n  - Recent surge: $1,120 to $1,135.10 (+$15.10 in one candle)\n- Risk assessment: Similar to BTC, RSI at 86.2 is at extreme overbought levels.

I need to evaluate whether to enter new positions based on current market conditions.\n\n### BTC Analysis\n- Current: $113,734 | EMA20: $111,346 (2.1% above)\n- RSI(7): 89.2 - EXTREMELY overbought (danger zone)\n- RSI(14): 83.6 - Also extremely overbought\n- MACD: 814.157 - Strong positive momentum but accelerating rapidly\n- Price action: Explosive move from $111,057 to $113,734 in 30 minutes (+2.4%)\n- **Assessment**: Parabolic move, RSI at dangerous levels. High probability of pullback. NOT entering at these levels - would be chasing.\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- Current: $4,074.90 | EMA20: $3,944.59 (3.3% above)\n- RSI(7): 89.0 - EXTREMELY overbought\n- RSI(14): 82.1 - Also extremely overbought\n- MACD: 36.064 - Strong momentum\n- Price action: Sharp rally from $3,921 to $4,074 (+3.9%)\n- **Assessment**: Similar to BTC - parabolic and overbought. Too risky to enter here.\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- Current: $199.44 | EMA20: $193.15 (3.3% above)\n- RSI(7): 86.0 - Extremely overbought\n- RSI(14): 78.8 - Overbought\n- MACD: 1.958 - Positive momentum\n- Price action: Rally from $191.76 to $199.44 (+4.0%)\n- **Assessment**: Overbought but slightly less extreme than BTC/ETH. Still too risky.\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- Current: $1,133.50 | EMA20: $1,116.18 (1.6% above)\n- RSI(7): 80.0 - Overbought but not extreme\n- RSI(14): 70.2 - Moderately overbought\n- MACD: 6.398 - Positive momentum\n- Price action: More controlled rally from $1,108 to $1,133.50 (+2.3%)\n- **Assessment**: Less extended than others, but still overbought.\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- Current: $2.64 | EMA20: $2.54 (3.9% above)\n- RSI(7): 84.6 - Extremely overbought (was 99+ earlier!)\n- RSI(14): 88.5 - Extremely overbought\n- MACD: 0.061 - Positive\n- Price action: Strong rally from $2.54 to $2.65 (+4.3%)\n- **Assessment**: Coming off extreme overbought levels (RSI was 99+). Dangerous to enter.\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- Current: $0.20299 | EMA20: $0.19708 (3.0% above)\n- RSI(7): 83.6 - Extremely overbought\n- RSI(14): 76.4 - Overbought\n- MACD: 0.001 - Positive\n- Price action: Rally from $0.1949 to $0.2030 (+4.2%)\n- **Assessment**: Overbought, volatile meme coin. High risk.\n\n## Trading Decision\n\n**ALL COINS ARE EXTREMELY OVERBOUGHT** - RSI(7) levels between 80-89 across the board indicate a coordinated market-wide rally that is overextended. This is a classic \"blow-off top\" pattern where entering now would be chasing momentum at the worst possible time.\n\n**Risk Management Principle**: Never enter positions when RSI(7) > 80. Wait for pullback to at least RSI < 60 or price to retrace to EMA20.\n\n**Decision**: STAY IN CASH. No positions to open. The market needs to cool off before safe entry points emerge.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

Current price is $2.63, well above this level. The position has NOT violated its invalidation condition.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Position is slightly profitable (+0.81%)\n- RSI has cooled from extreme levels (100 \u2192 59.8), reducing overbought risk\n- Price is consolidating after a strong move, which is healthy\n- Still above all key support levels (EMA20 at $2.56, stop-loss at $2.54)\n\n**Decision: HOLD**\nThe position remains valid. No invalidation condition met, stop-loss not hit, and technical structure remains bullish. The RSI cooling is actually positive - it reduces the risk of an immediate reversal while maintaining upward momentum. Price is consolidating near highs, which could lead to another leg up toward the $2.78 profit target.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** RSI 92.8 (7-period) - EXTREMELY overbought, dangerous entry point\n**ETH:** RSI 94.0 (7-period) - EXTREMELY overbought, dangerous entry point  \n**SOL:** RSI 90.9 (7-period) - EXTREMELY overbought, dangerous entry point\n**BNB:** RSI 83.3 (7-period) - Very overbought\n**DOGE:** RSI 84.7 (7-period) - Very overbought\n\nAll major coins are showing extreme overbought conditions on short-term RSI. This is NOT the time to enter new positions. The market is overextended and due for a pullback. Risk management dictates staying out of new trades when RSI > 85.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1230.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.78,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.54,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.54 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown of uptrend support\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Current price at $2.63 is still 3.5% above the stop-loss level. While momentum has cooled (RSI dropped from extreme overbought to neutral), the uptrend structure remains intact with price above key EMAs. The position is slightly profitable and the technical setup hasn't broken down.\n\nHowever, I notice concerning momentum loss:\n- RSI dropped sharply from 77 to 43 in latest candle\n- Price pulled back from $2.67 high to $2.63\n- This suggests potential consolidation or minor correction\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nWith 15x leverage, this position has significant risk. The stop-loss at $2.54 provides 3.5% downside protection (which equals ~52% loss at 15x leverage). Given the momentum slowdown but intact structure, I'll maintain the position but remain vigilant.\n\n**Other Coins - No Entry Signals:**\n- **BTC**: RSI crashed from 94 to 34 (oversold), but after such extreme overbought readings, this could be healthy correction. Price still above EMA20. Too uncertain for new entry.\n- **ETH**: Similar pattern - RSI dropped from 94 to 39. Consolidating after strong rally. No clear setup.\n- **SOL**: RSI at 36, weakening momentum. No compelling entry.\n- **BNB**: RSI at 40, pulled back from highs. Neutral.\n- **DOGE**: RSI at 27 (oversold), but price below EMA20. Weak structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nHOLD XRP position as invalidation condition not met.

This is a significant market-wide correction.\n\n## Position Review: XRP\n\n**Current Position Details:**\n- Entry: $2.6132\n- Current Price: $2.602\n- Unrealized P&L: -$15.38 (-0.42%)\n- Stop-Loss: $2.54\n- Profit Target: $2.78\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below $2.54 on 3-minute candle\"\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n- RSI (7-period): 21.015 - Oversold but not extreme\n- RSI (14-period): 34.127 - Moderately oversold\n- MACD: 0.005 - Weakening but still slightly positive\n- Price vs EMA20: $2.60 vs $2.63 - Below EMA, bearish\n- Recent price action: Dropped from $2.67 to $2.60 in last 30 minutes\n- Current price $2.60 is still $0.06 ABOVE stop-loss at $2.54\n\n**Invalidation Check:**\nThe invalidation condition states: \"If price closes below $2.54 on 3-minute candle\"\n- Current price: $2.602\n- Stop-loss level: $2.54\n- The price has NOT closed below $2.54 yet\n- Invalidation condition is NOT met\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nDespite the selloff and bearish momentum, the position has not hit its stop-loss or invalidation level. The price is holding above $2.54, which was the defined risk level. RSI at 21 suggests potential oversold bounce. The loss is minimal at -0.42%. \n\nHowever, the broader market context is concerning - all coins showing extreme weakness with RSI readings in oversold territory (BTC RSI 19.5, ETH RSI 11.6, DOGE RSI 7.3). This suggests systemic selling pressure.\n\nGiven that:\n1. Invalidation condition NOT met (price still above $2.54)\n2. Stop-loss NOT hit\n3. Small unrealized loss\n4. Oversold RSI could lead to bounce\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - The position's risk parameters have not been breached. Will maintain position and let stop-loss protect if price continues lower.\n\n## Other Coins Analysis\n\n**BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, DOGE**: No positions. All showing extreme oversold conditions (RSI 7-20 range), but catching falling knives in a market-wide selloff is high risk. The momentum is strongly bearish across all timeframes. Will wait for stabilization signals before considering new entries.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1230.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.78,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.54,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.54 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown of uptrend support\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The condition is NOT met.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nDespite the oversold RSI suggesting a potential bounce, the position is showing weakness:\n1. Price is below EMA20 and trending down\n2. MACD is deteriorating (from 0.015 to 0.004)\n3. Volume is significantly below average (3.18M vs 7.01M average)\n4. The position is essentially flat with minimal loss\n\nHowever, the invalidation condition has NOT been triggered. The stop-loss at $2.54 provides adequate protection. Given the oversold RSI readings (29.076 on 7-period, 38.055 on 14-period), there's potential for a bounce back toward the profit target at $2.78.\n\n**Other Markets:**\n- BTC: RSI 16.001 - extremely oversold, sharp selloff\n- ETH: RSI 23.917 - oversold\n- SOL: RSI 16.824 - extremely oversold\n- BNB: RSI 15.992 - extremely oversold\n- DOGE: RSI 6.467 - catastrophically oversold\n\nAll markets are showing extreme oversold conditions, suggesting a potential market-wide bounce. However, this could also indicate capitulation or further downside. Given the extreme conditions, I'll maintain the XRP position as the invalidation has not been met and oversold conditions often precede bounces.\n\n**Final Decision:** HOLD XRP - invalidation condition not met, oversold RSI suggests potential bounce, stop-loss provides protection.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1230.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.78,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.54,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.54 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown of uptrend support\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, I'm observing:\n1. MACD momentum is fading (dropped from 0.013 to 0.003)\n2. Volume is extremely low (only 28% of average) - lack of conviction\n3. Price is consolidating tightly around EMA20\n4. Small profit of only $23.48 on $3,239 notional\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - The invalidation condition is not met, and the position is still valid. Price is holding support at EMA20 and RSI shows room for upside. The low volume is concerning but not a reason to exit prematurely. Will continue monitoring for either profit target ($2.78) or stop-loss ($2.54) to be hit.\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- **BTC**: Price at $113,569, below EMA20 ($113,524). RSI recovering to 50.5 after oversold. MACD weakening. No clear setup.\n- **ETH**: Price at $4,022, below EMA20 ($4,057). RSI at 39.4 showing weakness. MACD positive but declining.

RSI at 44.2, MACD negative. Weak momentum.\n- **DOGE**: Price at $0.1943, well below EMA20 ($0.1982). RSI at 28.4 - oversold but in downtrend.

Price is within 0.34% of stop-loss with 15x leverage\n2. Strong downward momentum (RSI 16.84, MACD negative and declining)\n3. Clear downtrend below EMA20\n4. High probability of hitting stop-loss on next candle\n\n**Risk Management Decision:**\nGiven the extreme proximity to stop-loss, severe oversold conditions, and strong bearish momentum, I should CLOSE this position now to avoid:\n- Slippage risk at stop-loss execution\n- Potential gap through stop-loss\n- Further deterioration in already negative position\n\nThe RSI at 16.84 suggests potential for a bounce, but with 15x leverage and only 0.34% buffer to stop-loss, the risk/reward is unfavorable. Better to take the small loss now than risk stop-loss execution or worse.\n\n## Other Coins Analysis\n\n**BTC:** RSI 13.152 (extremely oversold), MACD -711.987 (very bearish), price well below EMA20. Severe downtrend but oversold conditions suggest potential bounce. However, momentum is strongly negative. No position - not entering in this volatility.\n\n**ETH:** RSI 13.487 (extremely oversold), similar to BTC. Strong downtrend. No position - avoiding.\n\n**SOL:** RSI 38.638 (neutral), MACD -1.258 (slightly bearish), price below EMA20. More stable than BTC/ETH but still weak. No position.\n\n**BNB:** RSI 41.918 (neutral), MACD -7.183 (bearish), price below EMA20. Weak but not extreme. No position.\n\n**DOGE:** RSI 36.784 (neutral-bearish), MACD -0.003 (bearish), price below EMA20. Weak trend. No position.\n\n**Overall Market Assessment:** Broad market weakness across all coins.

When RSI(7) drops below 20 across multiple assets simultaneously, it typically indicates capitulation selling and presents mean reversion opportunities. The key indicators:\n\n1. **Multiple assets at extreme RSI levels** - Suggests market-wide panic rather than asset-specific issues\n2. **Elevated volume** - Confirms genuine selling pressure, not just low liquidity drift\n3. **All prices below EMA20** - Clear downtrend, but oversold conditions suggest near-term bounce potential\n4. **MACD deeply negative** - Momentum is bearish but at extremes that often precede reversals\n\n**Strategy**: Enter small, high-conviction positions on the most oversold assets (ETH and DOGE) with tight stop-losses. These are counter-trend trades targeting short-term mean reversion bounces, not trend reversals.\n\n**Risk Management**:\n- Position sizing: ~$500 risk per trade (~5% of capital each)\n- Leverage: 15x to maximize capital efficiency while maintaining manageable position sizes\n- Stop-losses: 2-3% below entry to limit downside\n- Profit targets: 3-5% above entry for 1.5:1 to 2:1 risk/reward\n- Invalidation: Further breakdown below recent lows\n\n**Selected Trades**:\n- **ETH**: RSI(7) at 10.29 is the most extreme reading - highest probability bounce candidate\n- **DOGE**: RSI(7) at 10.70, second most oversold - good risk/reward for mean reversion\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 3925.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3680.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3680 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued breakdown rather than oversold bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 42000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.1890,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.1755,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.1755 on 3-minute candle, confirming further capitulation rather than reversal\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Given the extreme oversold conditions (RSI 6.60), there's potential for a bounce, but the risk is very high. I will HOLD for now but acknowledge we're on the edge.\n\n### DOGE Position Analysis\n- Entry: 0.18055, Current: 0.17684\n- Unrealized P&L: -$159.61 (-2.05%)\n- Stop-loss: 0.1755, Profit target: 0.189\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below 0.1755 on 3-minute candle\"\n- Current price: 0.17684\n- Invalidation level: 0.1755\n- **CRITICAL**: 0.17684 > 0.1755, so we are $0.00134 above the invalidation level\n- This is ABOVE the stop-loss by only 0.76%\n- RSI(7) = 8.01 is extremely oversold, suggesting potential bounce\n- MACD = -0.005 shows strong downward momentum\n\n**Decision**: The invalidation condition has NOT been met (0.17684 > 0.1755), but we are very close. Given extreme oversold RSI of 8.01, there's potential for a bounce. I will HOLD but this is high risk.\n\n## Risk Management Assessment\n- Total account value: $9,850.86\n- Current drawdown: -1.49%\n- Combined unrealized loss: -$332.78 (-3.38% of account)\n- Both positions are near their stop-loss levels\n- Sharpe ratio of 2.742 is healthy\n\n## Market Context\nThis appears to be a flash crash or severe liquidation cascade. RSI readings in the 6-11 range are extremely rare and typically precede violent bounces. However, the momentum is still strongly negative, and we could see further downside before any reversal.\n\n## Final Decision\nBoth positions are technically still valid (invalidation conditions not met), but are hanging by a thread. Given the extreme oversold conditions across the entire market, I will HOLD both positions with the expectation of a potential oversold bounce. If either position closes below its invalidation level on the next candle, they should be immediately closed.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 3925.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3680.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3680 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued breakdown rather than oversold bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 42000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.189,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.1755,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.1755 on 3-minute candle, confirming further capitulation rather than reversal\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

No exit conditions triggered.\n\n## Other Coins (BTC, SOL, BNB, XRP)\n- **BTC**: Severe downtrend, RSI 41.193, MACD deeply negative (-1681.654), price at 108360 vs EMA20 111252.79. Down from 113134 to 106526 low. Too risky to enter during this volatility.\n- **SOL**: Downtrend, RSI 37.873, MACD -3.576, price 184.62 vs EMA20 193.10. Weak momentum.\n- **BNB**: Downtrend, RSI 37.084, MACD -14.830, price 1078.20 vs EMA20 1108.39. Not attractive.\n- **XRP**: Weak, RSI 32.819, MACD -0.052, price 2.44 vs EMA20 2.56. Oversold but no clear reversal.\n- **Decision**: No new positions. Market showing broad weakness across all assets. My existing positions are working as planned with proper risk management.\n\n## Risk Management Summary\n- Current account value: $10,352.59 (+3.53% total return)\n- Both positions showing unrealized profits\n- Both positions have clear invalidation conditions that are NOT met\n- Stop-losses in place protecting capital\n- Sharpe ratio: 2.742 (excellent risk-adjusted returns)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 3925.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3680.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3680 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued breakdown rather than oversold bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 42000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.189,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.1755,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.1755 on 3-minute candle, confirming further capitulation rather than reversal\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
