I need to analyze the current market state across all coins to identify the best entry opportunities.\n\n## Market Overview Analysis\n\n**BTC (109160):**\n- Price well below EMA20 (111104.55), indicating downtrend\n- MACD deeply negative (-1429.362) and still declining\n- RSI (7-period) at 43.856 - recovering from oversold but not yet bullish\n- Recent sharp drop from 111405 to 108211, now recovering to 109160\n- Price below both 20-period and 50-period EMAs (bearish structure)\n- Low volume (3548 vs avg 7856) suggests weak conviction\n- **Assessment:** Bearish trend but showing signs of bottoming. Too early to enter.\n\n**ETH (3930.90):**\n- Price below EMA20 (4023.44), downtrend confirmed\n- MACD negative (-71.784) but slightly improving from -72.725\n- RSI (7-period) at 45.554 - neutral, recovering from 21.372 low\n- Similar pattern to BTC: sharp drop from 4061.40 to 3864.90, now recovering\n- Below both EMAs, bearish structure\n- Very low volume (52185 vs avg 135853) - weak participation\n- **Assessment:** Bearish but attempting recovery. Not yet convincing.\n\n**SOL (186.91):**\n- Price significantly below EMA20 (195.30), strong downtrend\n- MACD negative (-5.057) and worsening\n- RSI (7-period) at 35.557 - still weak, recovering from 19.011\n- Sharp drop from 196.80 to 184.76, slight recovery\n- Below both EMAs, bearish structure\n- Low volume (464414 vs avg 1197511)\n- **Assessment:** Weak and oversold but no reversal signal yet.\n\n**BNB (1149.30):**\n- Price well below EMA20 (1188.16), downtrend\n- MACD negative (-31.536) but slightly improving\n- RSI (7-period) at 37.756 - recovering from extreme oversold (13.516)\n- Price dropped from 1183.80 to 1134.80, now recovering\n- Below both EMAs, bearish structure\n- Very low volume (4336 vs avg 19293)\n- **Assessment:** Oversold bounce potential but trend still bearish.\n\n**XRP (2.36):**\n- Price below EMA20 (2.44), downtrend\n- MACD negative (-0.058) and stable\n- RSI (7-period) at 41.475 - recovering from 20.237, showing momentum\n- Drop from 2.45 to 2.33, now recovering to 2.36\n- Volume above average (13076200 vs 10321690) - NOTABLE\n- **Assessment:** Showing relative strength with volume support. Best candidate.\n\n**DOGE (0.190230):**\n- Price below EMA20 (0.198261), downtrend\n- MACD negative (-0.005) and stable\n- RSI (7-period) at 37.342 - recovering from 18.498\n- Drop from 0.200260 to 0.187720, now recovering\n- Low volume (16194734 vs avg 67545594)\n- **Assessment:** Weak with poor volume. Pass.\n\n## Trading Decision\n\nAll markets are in downtrends but showing signs of bottoming after sharp drops. XRP stands out with:\n1. Above-average volume (bullish divergence)\n2. RSI recovering from extreme oversold\n3. Smallest relative distance from EMA20\n4. Most stable MACD deterioration\n\nHowever, given this is the FIRST trade and all markets are bearish, I should be cautious. The prudent approach is to wait for clearer reversal signals rather than catch a falling knife. \n\n**DECISION:** Stay in cash and wait for better risk/reward setups. All coins are below their EMAs with negative MACD, indicating the downtrend is intact. The recent bounce could be a dead cat bounce. Better to preserve capital and wait for confirmed reversals (price above EMA20, MACD turning positive, RSI above 50).\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

      "raw_response": "# CHAIN OF THOUGHT\n\n## Market Overview Analysis\nThe entire crypto market is experiencing a severe selloff across all major coins:\n- **BTC**: Down to 105,589 from recent highs around 111,268 (-5.1%). RSI(7) at 17.8 (extremely oversold), RSI(14) at 22.3\n- **ETH**: Down to 3,756 from 4,061 (-7.5%). RSI(7) at 20.6 (extremely oversold), RSI(14) at 25.5\n- **SOL**: Down to 177.65 from 196.80 (-9.7%). RSI(7) at 16.4 (extremely oversold), RSI(14) at 21.5\n- **BNB**: Down to 1,062 from 1,183 (-10.2%). RSI(7) at 9.5 (EXTREMELY oversold), RSI(14) at 14.7\n- **XRP**: Down to 2.24 from 2.45 (-8.6%). RSI(7) at 17.4 (extremely oversold), RSI(14) at 21.1\n- **DOGE**: Down to 0.1785 from 0.2003 (-10.9%). RSI(7) at 14.8 (extremely oversold), RSI(14) at 19.2\n\n## Current Position Status\nI have **NO OPEN POSITIONS** currently. Starting with $10,000 cash.\n\n## Trading Opportunity Assessment\n\n### Key Technical Observations:\n1. **All coins showing extreme oversold conditions** - RSI(7) below 20 across the board\n2. **All prices trading well below EMA20** - indicating strong downtrend but potential reversal zone\n3. **MACD deeply negative** on all coins - bearish momentum but reaching extremes\n4. **Volume elevated** - particularly on SOL, DOGE, XRP suggesting capitulation\n5. **All coins at support zones** - these are potential bounce levels\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n- **High volatility environment** - ATR elevated across all coins\n- **Catching falling knives risk** - market could continue lower\n- **Counter-trend opportunity** - extreme oversold readings often precede bounces\n- **This is the START of trading** (0 minutes in) - need to be cautious with initial positions\n\n### Trading Strategy:\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions across ALL coins simultaneously, this suggests:\n1. Market-wide panic/capitulation event\n2. High probability of short-term bounce/relief rally\n3. Should use tight stop-losses given downtrend momentum\n4. Focus on coins with strongest oversold readings and best risk/reward\n\n### Position Selection:\nI will enter **3 positions** with tight risk management:\n\n1. **BNB** - RSI(7) at 9.5 is EXTREMELY oversold (most extreme of all coins). Down 10.2% in short period.\n2. **DOGE** - RSI(7) at 14.8, down 10.9%, elevated volume suggests capitulation\n3. **SOL** - RSI(7) at 16.4, down 9.7%, strong support zone\n\n**Why not BTC/ETH/XRP?**: While also oversold, BNB, DOGE, and SOL show more extreme readings and typically have stronger bounce potential from these levels.\n\n### Position Sizing:\n- Risk $500-600 per position (~5-6% of capital per trade)\n- Use 15x leverage for better capital efficiency\n- Total risk exposure: ~$1,500-1,800 (15-18% of capital)\n- This allows for multiple positions while maintaining prudent risk management\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.85,\n      \"profit_target\": 1095.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1045.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1045 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) makes lower low below 9 without price making lower low\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 550.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 33500,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.184500,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.175000,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.1750 on 3-minute candle or fails to bounce within next 30 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 580.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 51,\n      \"profit_target\": 183.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 174.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 174.00 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) fails to move above 25 within 6 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.70,\n      \"risk_usd\": 560.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "# CHAIN OF THOUGHT\n\nAnalyzing market conditions: We're seeing a sharp market-wide selloff with all coins showing significant bearish pressure. Let me review each of my 3 open positions against their invalidation conditions:\n\n## BNB Position Analysis\n- Entry: 1062.6, Current: 1071.70 (+0.86%)\n- Unrealized PnL: +$7.28\n- Stop-loss: 1045.0, Profit target: 1095.0\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below 1045 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) makes lower low below 9 without price making lower low\"\n- Current RSI(7): 18.184 (previous low was 9.588)\n- Price action: Recent low was 1062.60, current 1071.70\n- **Analysis**: RSI made a lower low (9.588) and now recovering to 18.184, but price did NOT make a lower low (bounced from 1062.60). The invalidation condition is NOT met. However, extremely oversold with RSI(7) at 18.184, RSI(14) at 20.900, and MACD deeply negative at -23.812. Price well below EMA20 (1153.12). This is extreme oversold territory but dangerous.\n- **Decision**: HOLD - invalidation not met, but watching closely. The bounce from 1062.60 shows support.\n\n## DOGE Position Analysis\n- Entry: 0.17849, Current: 0.18261 (+2.31%)\n- Unrealized PnL: +$135.03\n- Stop-loss: 0.175, Profit target: 0.1845\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below 0.1750 on 3-minute candle or fails to bounce within next 30 minutes\"\n- Current price: 0.18261 (well above stop-loss at 0.175)\n- Recent low: 0.17849 (our entry), bounced to 0.18261\n- **Analysis**: Price is approaching profit target (0.1845) at 0.18261. Already bounced from lows. RSI(7) at 33.667 showing recovery from extreme oversold (14.801). The position has already bounced within the timeframe, so invalidation is NOT met. We're only 0.00189 away from profit target.\n- **Decision**: HOLD - Very close to profit target. Let it run to 0.1845.\n\n## SOL Position Analysis\n- Entry: 177.65, Current: 181.47 (+2.15%)\n- Unrealized PnL: +$190.29\n- Stop-loss: 174.0, Profit target: 183.5\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below 174.00 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) fails to move above 25 within 6 candles\"\n- Current RSI(7): 35.632 (well above 25, and has moved above 25)\n- Price: 181.47 (well above stop-loss at 174.0)\n- **Analysis**: RSI(7) successfully moved above 25 (now at 35.632), so invalidation is NOT met. Price recovering nicely from 177.65 entry. Only 2.03 points away from profit target at 183.5. Strong bounce showing.\n- **Decision**: HOLD - Close to profit target, invalidation not met, let it hit target.\n\n## Other Coins (BTC, ETH, XRP)\nAll showing severe bearish conditions with extremely low RSI levels and prices well below EMAs. However, these extreme oversold conditions could present bounce opportunities. Given I already have 3 positions totaling significant exposure ($16,283 notional), I should not add new positions. Risk management dictates waiting for clearer signals.\n\n**Portfolio Status**: Total unrealized PnL: +$332.60 (+3.47% return). All three positions are profitable and approaching profit targets. None have met invalidation conditions. Market is extremely oversold but showing signs of bounce.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.85,\n      \"profit_target\": 1095.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1045.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1045 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) makes lower low below 9 without price making lower low\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 550.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 33500.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.1845,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.175,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.1750 on 3-minute candle or fails to bounce within next 30 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 580.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 51.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 183.5,\n      \"stop_loss\": 174.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 174.00 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) fails to move above 25 within 6 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 560.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price is 68 points below EMA20, MACD deeply negative, and RSI still in oversold territory. The bounce from 1062.6 to 1074.0 is minimal. Risk of further downside is high.\n\n**Decision**: **CLOSE POSITION** - While invalidation not technically met, this is a risk management decision. The trend is severely bearish, we're far from profit target, and the small bounce doesn't indicate reversal. Better to take small profit and preserve capital.\n\n## SOL Position Analysis\n- **Entry**: 177.65, **Current**: 182.74 (+2.86%)\n- **Unrealized PnL**: +$255.06 (excellent!)\n- **Profit Target**: 183.5 (only 0.76 away!)\n- **Stop Loss**: 174.0 (8.74 points away)\n- **Invalidation Condition**: \"If price closes below 174.00 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) fails to move above 25 within 6 candles\"\n\n**Technical Analysis**:\n- RSI(7): 41.565 - recovered nicely from 16.400, now above 25 threshold\n- RSI(14): 36.982 - still oversold but improving\n- MACD: -3.878 - negative but improving from -3.728\n- Price vs EMA20: 182.74 vs 189.96 - below but recovering\n- Recent price action: Strong recovery from 177.65 to 182.74\n\n**Invalidation Check**:\n- Price is NOT below 174.0 (currently 182.74)\n- RSI(7) HAS moved above 25 (currently 41.565) - condition satisfied\n- **Invalidation condition NOT met** - position is healthy\n\n**Profit Target Analysis**: Current price 182.74 vs target 183.5 - we're only $0.76 away from profit target! This is within striking distance.\n\n**Decision**: **CLOSE POSITION** - Take profits! We're up 2.86% (+$255), nearly at profit target (183.5), and given the volatile market conditions (BTC down, most alts weak), it's prudent to lock in this excellent gain rather than risk a reversal.\n\n## Other Coins (No Positions)\n- **BTC**: Down heavily, RSI 39.6, MACD very negative - bearish, no entry\n- **ETH**: Down, RSI 33.9, below EMA20 - bearish, no entry  \n- **XRP**: Weak recovery, RSI 42.8, MACD negative - no clear setup\n- **DOGE**: Similar to XRP, weak technical picture - no entry\n\nMarket is in risk-off mode with significant selling pressure across the board.

      "raw_response": "# CHAIN OF THOUGHT\n\nAnalyzing market conditions across all coins:\n\n**Market Overview:**\nAll major cryptocurrencies are showing significant bearish pressure with prices trading well below their 20-period EMAs. RSI values are mostly in oversold territory (BNB at extreme 17.9, SOL at 38.4, BTC at 35.3), and MACD indicators are deeply negative across the board. This suggests a strong downtrend with potential for a bounce.\n\n**Current Portfolio Status:**\n- No open positions\n- Available cash: $10,454.84\n- Current return: +4.55% (excellent performance)\n- Sharpe Ratio: 97.578 (exceptional risk-adjusted returns)\n\n**Individual Coin Analysis:**\n\n**BTC (Current: $106,421)**\n- Down 3.6% from recent highs (~$110,526)\n- RSI(7): 35.3 - approaching oversold\n- RSI(14): 32.2 - oversold territory\n- MACD: -1612 and declining\n- Price $2,856 below EMA20 ($109,277)\n- Volume below average (6,003 vs 8,339)\n- Assessment: Strong downtrend but showing oversold conditions. Risk of further downside given momentum, but potential for bounce exists.\n\n**ETH (Current: $3,825.70)**\n- Down 5.8% from recent peak (~$4,061)\n- RSI(7): 43.7 - neutral to slightly weak\n- RSI(14): 37.7 - approaching oversold\n- MACD: -71.5 and declining\n- Price $108 below EMA20 ($3,933.51)\n- Volume below average\n- Assessment: Bearish but less oversold than BTC. Still in downtrend.\n\n**SOL (Current: $181.93)**\n- Down 7.5% from recent high (~$196.80)\n- RSI(7): 38.4 - oversold\n- RSI(14): 34.2 - oversold\n- MACD: -5.25 and declining\n- Price $8.20 below EMA20 ($190.13)\n- Assessment: Oversold with potential for bounce, but downtrend intact.\n\n**BNB (Current: $1,066.10)**\n- Down 9.9% from recent high (~$1,183.80)\n- RSI(7): 17.9 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 19.0 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- MACD: -33.5 and declining sharply\n- Price $74.78 below EMA20 ($1,140.88)\n- Assessment: Most oversold of all coins. High probability of bounce but momentum very negative.\n\n**XRP (Current: $2.30)**\n- Down 6.1% from recent high (~$2.45)\n- RSI(7): 41.4 - neutral\n- RSI(14): 36.6 - approaching oversold\n- MACD: -0.053 and declining\n- Price $0.08 below EMA20 ($2.38)\n- Assessment: Relatively stable, least oversold.\n\n**DOGE (Current: $0.18427)**\n- Down 8.0% from recent high (~$0.20026)\n- RSI(7): 40.8 - neutral\n- RSI(14): 35.7 - approaching oversold\n- MACD: -0.005 and declining\n- Price below EMA20 ($0.19219)\n- Assessment: Oversold but showing some stabilization.\n\n**Trading Decision:**\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions, particularly in BNB (RSI 17.9), there's a high probability of a technical bounce. However, all coins show strong bearish momentum with declining MACDs and prices well below EMAs. \n\n**Strategy:** I will enter a LONG position on BNB due to its extreme oversold condition (RSI 17.9 is exceptionally rare) with tight risk management. The risk/reward is favorable for a counter-trend bounce trade. I'll use moderate leverage (15x) and strict stop-loss.\n\nPosition sizing: Risk $500 (~4.8% of capital) on BNB bounce trade.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.07,\n      \"profit_target\": 1105.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1040.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,040 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) fails to bounce above 25 within next 15 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The position is showing extreme weakness:\n1. Deep below EMA20 ($62.60 gap)\n2. Strongly negative MACD (-33.560)\n3. Very low volume suggests weak conviction\n4. Only marginal profit (+$0.28)\n5. 15x leverage creates high liquidation risk\n\nHowever, strictly reading the invalidation condition: RSI(7) IS above 25 (25.059), so technically not invalidated yet. But the market structure is extremely bearish. Given the high leverage (15x), minimal profit, and weak technicals, the risk/reward favors closing this position to preserve capital.\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION** - The bounce is too weak, RSI barely above threshold, and bearish momentum remains strong. Better to take the small profit and avoid potential whipsaw with 15x leverage.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE, DOGE: All showing oversold conditions (RSI 7-period: 35-45 range) with negative MACD\n- All trading below their EMA20s (bearish structure)\n- Market appears to be in a correction phase across the board\n- Given weak market conditions and my risk management principles, not opening new positions\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.07,\n      \"profit_target\": 1105.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1040.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,040 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) fails to bounce above 25 within next 15 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Weak bounce with RSI(7) barely above 25 threshold (25.059), strong bearish momentum (MACD -33.56), price $62.60 below EMA20, and very low volume.

The trade thesis remains valid, price is respecting support levels, and we're seeing technical improvement.\n\n**Other Coins (BTC, SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE):**\nNo positions held. Market conditions show weakness across the board (most below EMA20, negative MACD). Not entering new positions at this time given the uncertain market environment and already having 96% of capital deployed in ETH.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 26.25,\n      \"profit_target\": 4050.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3750.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,750 on 3-minute candle, indicating failed bounce and continuation of downtrend\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 209.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The lowest recent price was $3,797.30, which is $47.30 above the invalidation level.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Position is profitable with +$867.96 unrealized gains\n- No signs of reversal below stop-loss\n- Technical momentum remains positive\n- 15x leverage is appropriate for current volatility\n- Distance to profit target: $145.30 (3.7% move needed)\n- Distance to stop-loss: $154.70 (3.96% buffer)\n\n**Decision: HOLD**\nThe position is performing well, invalidation condition is not met, and technical indicators support continuation. The MACD is improving, RSI shows strength without extreme overbought conditions, and price is above EMA20.

Not compelling enough for new entry with current downtrend structure.\n\n**SOL:** Price at $186.90 near EMA20 ($186.78), neutral setup. MACD improving but still negative. Not a clear setup.\n\n**BNB:** Weak - price $1,091.10 well below EMA20 ($1,110.60), RSI(7) only 43.76, negative MACD. Downtrend intact.\n\n**XRP:** Consolidating around $2.37, near EMA20. RSI 62.833 shows some strength but range-bound action. No clear edge.\n\n**DOGE:** Strong momentum - RSI(7) 79.484 is extremely overbought. Price $0.19053 above EMA20 ($0.18921). However, this level of RSI indicates overextension and high risk of pullback. Not entering at these levels.\n\n**Conclusion:** Only ETH position warrants holding.

RSI >80 typically precedes short-term pullbacks. While trend is strong, entering at these levels carries high reversal risk.\n- **Decision**: PASS - Too overbought for safe entry\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- **Price action**: Rally from 3,876 to 3,984 (+2.79%)\n- **Technical indicators**:\n  - RSI(7): 86.2 - EXTREMELY overbought\n  - RSI(14): 75.4 - Overbought\n  - MACD: 16.08 (positive and accelerating)\n  - Price above EMA20 (3,984 vs 3,899)\n- **Assessment**: Similar to BTC - strong momentum but RSI >85 is extreme. High probability of near-term pullback or consolidation.\n- **Decision**: PASS - Too overbought for safe entry\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- **Price action**: Volatile, peaked at 190.67, now at 188.81\n- **Technical indicators**:\n  - RSI(7): 58.5 - Neutral zone\n  - RSI(14): 59.5 - Neutral\n  - MACD: 0.66 (positive and building)\n  - Price above EMA20 (188.81 vs 186.53)\n- **Assessment**: Most balanced setup. RSI cooled from 80+ to 58, showing healthy consolidation after rally. MACD turning positive. Price holding above EMA20 with room to run before overbought.\n- **Decision**: STRONG BUY CANDIDATE - Best risk/reward setup\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- **Price action**: Recovery from 1,083 to 1,116\n- **Technical indicators**:\n  - RSI(7): 69.4 - Approaching overbought\n  - RSI(14): 59.5 - Neutral\n  - MACD: -5.19 (negative but improving)\n  - Price above EMA20 (1,116 vs 1,105)\n- **Assessment**: Decent setup but MACD still negative. Less compelling than SOL.\n- **Decision**: PASS - Prefer SOL's cleaner setup\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- **Price action**: Steady climb from 2.35 to 2.40\n- **Technical indicators**:\n  - RSI(7): 72.1 - Overbought\n  - RSI(14): 65.4 - Moderately overbought\n  - MACD: 0.012 (positive but weak)\n  - Price above EMA20 (2.40 vs 2.35)\n- **Assessment**: RSI getting extended. Momentum is present but not as strong as others.\n- **Decision**: PASS - RSI too high for entry\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- **Price action**: Strong rally from 0.1877 to 0.1967 (+4.8%)\n- **Technical indicators**:\n  - RSI(7): 86.2 - EXTREMELY overbought\n  - RSI(14): 77.2 - Overbought\n  - MACD: 0.002 (positive)\n  - Price well above EMA20 (0.1967 vs 0.1899)\n- **Assessment**: Strongest price move but most overbought. High reversal risk.\n- **Decision**: PASS - Too overbought\n\n## Trading Decision\n\n**SOL is the clear winner** - it has:\n1. Healthy RSI pullback to neutral zone (58.5)\n2. Positive MACD momentum building (0.664)\n3. Price above EMA20 showing trend support\n4. Room to run before hitting overbought levels\n5. Clean technical setup with defined risk\n\n**Position sizing**: With $13,120 available and excellent Sharpe ratio, I'll allocate ~$1,000 risk (7.6% of capital) using 15x leverage for $15,000 position size (~79 SOL).\n\n**Risk parameters**:\n- Entry: 188.81\n- Stop-loss: 184.00 (2.55% below entry, below recent support at 184.91)\n- Profit target: 195.00 (3.28% above entry, conservative given volatility)\n- Invalidation: If RSI(7) drops below 45 or price closes below 183.00\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 79,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 184.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If RSI(7) drops below 45 or price closes below 183.00 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1000\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

RSI(7) at 37.959 is significantly below the 45 threshold I set when entering this trade. This indicates the momentum that justified the entry has reversed. The price is also showing a clear downtrend from the recent high of 192.93. While the position is only down $10.62 (minimal loss), the technical setup that justified the trade no longer exists.\n\n**Risk Management:**\nWith 15x leverage on this position, I need to respect my invalidation conditions strictly. The RSI dropping below 45 signals weakening momentum, and holding through this could lead to larger losses if the downtrend continues toward the stop-loss at 184.0.\n\n**Other Coins - No Entry Signals:**\n- **BTC**: RSI(7) 70.251, overbought after strong rally. Price 110753 near recent highs. Not entering at these extended levels.\n- **ETH**: RSI(7) 40.564, showing weakness after peaking. No clear setup.\n- **BNB**: RSI(7) 32.170, oversold but no confirmation of reversal yet.\n- **XRP**: RSI(7) 89.376, extremely overbought. Chasing momentum at these levels is risky.\n- **DOGE**: RSI(7) 66.693, decent but no compelling setup with available capital.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nClose SOL position due to invalidation condition being met (RSI(7) < 45).\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 79.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 184.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If RSI(7) drops below 45 or price closes below 183.00 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1000.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation condition met - RSI(7) dropped to 37.959, below the 45 threshold.

The position is experiencing normal volatility within the trade plan. RSI shows oversold conditions which could lead to a bounce. The stop-loss at $2.35 is appropriately placed and has not been hit. \n\n**DECISION: HOLD** - The trade thesis remains intact. Price is consolidating and has not violated the stop-loss or invalidation condition. The oversold RSI suggests potential for recovery toward the profit target.\n\n## Other Market Opportunities\n\n**BTC:** Price $108,160 - Heavy selling pressure with RSI at 35.6 (oversold). Below EMA20. Not entering due to downtrend momentum.\n\n**ETH:** Price $3,857 - RSI 32.2 (oversold), below EMA20. Weak momentum, avoiding new entry.\n\n**SOL:** Price $185.16 - RSI 35.1 (oversold), below EMA20. Similar weakness across the board.\n\n**BNB:** Price $1,067 - RSI 38.2, MACD negative. Bearish structure.\n\n**DOGE:** Price $0.1937 - RSI 34.4 (oversold), below EMA20. Weak momentum.\n\nAll markets showing synchronized weakness with oversold RSI readings.

Price is trading below the EMA20 ($2.43), indicating short-term bearish pressure\n2. RSI at 32.39 shows oversold conditions but no bounce yet\n3. MACD is declining toward zero, showing momentum loss\n4. Current price $2.41 is only $0.06 above stop-loss at $2.35 (2.5% buffer)\n5. The invalidation condition has NOT been met yet (price hasn't closed below $2.35)\n6. However, we're dangerously close to the stop-loss level\n\n**Risk Management Decision:**\nWhile the invalidation condition hasn't technically been met, the position is:\n- Down 3.41% with weakening technicals\n- Very close to stop-loss ($0.06 buffer)\n- Trading in oversold territory but no reversal signals yet\n- MACD momentum declining\n\nGiven the proximity to stop-loss and deteriorating technicals, I should HOLD and let the stop-loss do its job rather than panic-close. The RSI oversold reading suggests a potential bounce could occur. The invalidation condition is clear and hasn't been breached yet.\n\n**Other Coins Assessment:**\n- **BTC**: RSI 37.27 (oversold), below EMA20, MACD declining - bearish, no entry\n- **ETH**: RSI 35.33 (oversold), below EMA20, MACD negative - bearish, no entry\n- **SOL**: RSI 34.24 (oversold), below EMA20, MACD negative - bearish, no entry\n- **BNB**: RSI 42.22, below EMA20, MACD negative - bearish, no entry\n- **DOGE**: RSI 29.10 (very oversold), below EMA20, MACD near zero - bearish, no entry\n\nAll major coins are showing oversold conditions and bearish momentum.

More importantly, examining the invalidation condition:\n\n- The invalidation states: \"If price closes below 2.35\"\n- Current price: 2.39\n- The price is hovering just 4 cents above the invalidation level\n- RSI (7-period) at 28.032 shows extreme oversold conditions\n- RSI (14-period) at 39.152 confirms bearish momentum\n- MACD at 0.014 is barely positive and declining\n- Price is below EMA20 (2.43), indicating bearish short-term trend\n- Price action shows consistent decline: 2.49 \u2192 2.45 \u2192 2.43 \u2192 2.39\n\n**Technical Context:**\n- XRP has dropped from 2.52 to 2.39 in the recent candles (5.2% decline)\n- The downtrend is clear and accelerating\n- Price is testing support at the invalidation level\n- With only 1.7% cushion to stop-loss and liquidation at 2.327, risk is extreme\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nWhile the invalidation condition technically requires a close BELOW 2.35, the current price at 2.39 is so close that I'm at extreme risk. The bearish momentum (declining RSI, negative MACD trend, below EMA) suggests high probability of hitting the stop-loss imminently. \n\nHowever, the RSI at 28 shows extreme oversold conditions which could lead to a bounce. The question is: do I wait for the invalidation to be fully triggered, or do I exit now to preserve capital?\n\nGiven:\n1. Price is only 4 cents from invalidation\n2. Strong bearish momentum\n3. Risk of slippage at stop-loss level\n4. Already down 4% on the position\n\n**DECISION: CLOSE POSITION** - The invalidation level is being tested and the risk/reward is unfavorable. Better to exit with a small loss than risk hitting stop-loss or liquidation.

Wait for reversal confirmation.\n\n**ETH (Current: $3,803.60):**\n- Price significantly below EMA20 ($3,907), bearish\n- MACD negative (-44.2) and declining\n- RSI(7) at 26.2, RSI(14) at 31.9 - deeply oversold\n- Dropped from $4,082 to $3,803 - strong selloff\n- Volume elevated (138k vs 108k avg)\n- **Assessment:** Extremely oversold, potential for bounce but downtrend strong. High risk.\n\n**SOL (Current: $180.00):**\n- Price well below EMA20 ($186.38)\n- MACD negative (-1.82)\n- RSI(7) at 17.1, RSI(14) at 28.5 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- Crashed from $196 to $180 - severe selloff\n- Volume spiked (1.04M vs 749k avg)\n- **Assessment:** Most oversold of all coins. Potential mean reversion candidate but catching falling knife risk.\n\n**BNB (Current: $1,070.80):**\n- Price below EMA20 ($1,086.31)\n- MACD negative (-11.6)\n- RSI(7) at 44.5, RSI(14) at 42.3 - neutral/slightly oversold\n- Relatively stable compared to others\n- **Assessment:** Less oversold, less attractive for bounce play.\n\n**XRP (Current: $2.36):**\n- Price below EMA20 ($2.42)\n- MACD negative (-0.008)\n- RSI(7) at 18.9, RSI(14) at 31.5 - very oversold\n- Dropped from $2.52 to $2.36\n- Volume elevated (10.5M vs 7.2M avg)\n- **Assessment:** Very oversold, potential bounce candidate.\n\n**DOGE (Current: $0.18978):**\n- Price below EMA20 ($0.19485)\n- MACD negative (-0.002)\n- RSI(7) at 25.3, RSI(14) at 32.6 - oversold\n- Volume elevated (47.6M vs 30.8M avg)\n- **Assessment:** Oversold but weakest technical setup.\n\n**Trading Decision:**\nAll coins are oversold and in downtrends. This presents potential mean reversion opportunities, but timing is critical. SOL shows the most extreme oversold conditions (RSI 17.1) with high volume, suggesting potential for a technical bounce.

However, RSI at 80.6 is dangerously overbought, suggesting imminent pullback risk. The profit target of $193.80 is only $2.76 away (1.4% move).\n\nKey considerations:\n1.

Strong recent momentum but unsustainable at these RSI levels\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nWith RSI at 80.6, there's high probability of a sharp pullback. Given we're so close to the profit target ($2.76 away) and the position is already profitable (+$426), the optimal risk/reward decision is to CLOSE and take profits rather than risk a reversal from overbought conditions.\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION**\nReason: Taking profits near target with extreme overbought conditions (RSI 80.6). Risk of reversal outweighs potential 1.4% gain to target.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, DOGE: No positions, not entering new trades given mixed signals and risk management after profitable SOL exit.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 120.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 193.80,\n      \"stop_loss\": 180.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $179 on 3-minute candle, indicating failed breakout above EMA20\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 740.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Taking profits near target ($191.04 vs $193.80 target, only 1.4% away) with extreme overbought conditions (RSI 80.6).

Price below $1,075? NO - Current $1,125.70 is well above\n2. MACD turned negative? NO - MACD is +5.318 and strengthening\n3. Stop-loss hit? NO - Stop at $1,075, current $1,125.70\n4. Profit target hit? NO - Target $1,180, current $1,125.70\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n- No invalidation conditions met\n- MACD remains strongly positive and improving\n- Price holding above EMA20 with bullish momentum\n- RSI shows strength but not extreme overbought (68.7 vs 80+)\n- Position up nearly 1% with room to run to $1,180 target\n- Risk management: Stop-loss properly positioned at $1,075 (-3.8% from entry)\n\n**Conclusion:** HOLD BNB position.

RSI 70.2 (overbought territory), MACD improving but still negative (-195.693). Price above EMA20. However, already have significant exposure via BNB. Not entering.\n\n**SOL:** Explosive move to $191.27. RSI at 81.5 (extremely overbought), MACD just turned positive (+0.222). Parabolic move from $180 to $191 suggests exhaustion risk. Too late to chase.\n\n**ETH:** Weak at $3,857, below EMA20 ($3,883.91). MACD negative (-29.437), RSI 48.5 (neutral). Downtrend intact. No setup.\n\n**XRP:** Consolidating around $2.39, below EMA20 ($2.42). MACD negative, RSI 43.4 (weak). No momentum.\n\n**DOGE:** At $0.1948, near EMA20. MACD nearly flat (-0.001), RSI 58.7 (neutral). No clear directional bias.\n\n**Portfolio Management:** Currently 98.4% deployed ($13,508 position / $13,727 account value). Maintaining single position with strong momentum is prudent.

NO - still $45.10 away\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe BNB position is performing well with strong technicals. MACD is positive and strengthening, price is above EMA20, and momentum is intact. While RSI shows overbought conditions (73.868), this is typical in strong uptrends. The invalidation conditions are NOT met - price is well above $1,075 and MACD remains positive. \n\nGiven the strong momentum, positive MACD trajectory, and no invalidation triggers, I will HOLD this position. The profit target at $1,180 is reasonable given the current momentum, and the stop loss at $1,075 provides adequate protection.\n\n**Other Coins Assessment:**\n- **BTC**: RSI 76.56 (overbought), MACD improving but still negative (-45.2). Price above EMA20. Strong momentum but no position to manage.\n- **ETH**: RSI 68.68, MACD negative (-24.76), price slightly above EMA20. Recovering but not compelling enough for new entry.\n- **SOL**: RSI 80.33 (very overbought), MACD barely positive (+0.327). Extended move, high risk for reversal.\n- **XRP**: Weak momentum, RSI 56.45, MACD negative, price below EMA20. No clear setup.\n- **DOGE**: RSI 63.02, MACD negative, price barely above EMA20. Weak setup.\n\nNone of the other coins present compelling risk/reward setups at current levels, especially with existing BNB exposure.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 12.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1180.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1075.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,075 on 3-minute candle or MACD turns negative again\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1000.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

RSI has dropped from 74 to 59.6 in just 6 minutes, indicating selling pressure. The price has pulled back from the recent high of $1,134.90, and while MACD is still positive at 12.138, the invalidation condition states \"or MACD turns negative again\" - meaning I need to watch for momentum deterioration.\n\n**Invalidation Check:**\n- Price NOT below $1,075 \u2713\n- MACD still positive (12.138) \u2713\n- However, momentum is clearly weakening\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nGiven the sharp RSI decline from overbought levels (74 \u2192 59.6), the price pullback from highs, and the fact that I'm only up $85.70 (0.63% on a 15x leveraged position = ~0.04% actual move), I should take profits here. The risk/reward is deteriorating as momentum fades. While the invalidation condition isn't technically met yet, the sharp momentum loss after an overbought reading is a classic reversal signal. Better to lock in gains than risk a reversal that could trigger the stop-loss.\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- **BTC**: RSI 84.6 (extremely overbought), MACD positive but extended. No position - not entering at these extreme levels.\n- **ETH**: RSI 83.3 (extremely overbought), strong rally but overextended. No position - risk too high.\n- **SOL**: RSI 85.0 (extremely overbought), massive rally from $180 to $192. No position - too late to chase.\n- **XRP**: RSI 76.7 (overbought), moderate momentum. No position - not compelling enough.\n- **DOGE**: RSI 74.3 (overbought), positive but extended. No position - avoiding meme coin volatility.\n\nAll major coins are showing overbought conditions.

Price is dangerously close to this level.\n\n2. **Stop-Loss Proximity**: Stop-loss at $1,100 is only $3.40 away (0.3%). This is extremely close and likely to be triggered soon.\n\n3. **Technical Deterioration**: \n   - RSI(7) plunged to 34.25 (oversold, from 59.5 previous)\n   - Price dropped sharply from $1,124.80 to $1,103.40\n   - MACD still positive (11.90) but declining from 13.46\n   - Price made a significant downward move in the last candle\n\n4. **Risk Assessment**: With 15x leverage and price near stop-loss, the risk of liquidation increases. The sharp RSI drop indicates strong selling pressure.\n\n**Decision**: CLOSE POSITION - The price is within $3.40 of the stop-loss and showing bearish momentum with RSI at 34.25. Rather than wait for the stop-loss to be hit (which may result in slippage), I should close now to preserve capital. The invalidation condition is nearly met as price approaches the critical $1,100 level.\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- **BTC**: RSI dropped to 44.88 from 85.06 - sharp reversal. Price at $110,109 below recent highs. Neutral, not entering.\n- **ETH**: RSI at 45.17, similar bearish reversal. Not entering.\n- **SOL**: RSI dropped to 38.01, oversold but no clear setup. Not entering.\n- **XRP**: RSI at 87.32, extremely overbought but strong momentum. Price above EMA20 ($2.48 vs $2.42). However, overbought conditions are risky for new entries.\n- **DOGE**: RSI at 43.87, neutral. Not entering.\n\nGiven the sharp reversals across all major coins (RSI drops from 80s to 40s), market conditions have turned bearish. Best to close BNB and preserve capital.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.07,\n      \"profit_target\": 1165.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1100.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below EMA20 ($1,100.54) on 3-minute candle, indicating trend failure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 398.52,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Price approaching stop-loss ($1,100) with only $3.40 buffer.

Price has held well above the $189.00 threshold and MACD remains positive at 2.068. The position is slightly profitable (+$160) and showing healthy momentum. Price is above EMA20, MACD is positive and rising, and while RSI is elevated at 70, it's not extreme. The recent dip to $189.29 was bought up quickly, showing support.

Price has not closed below $189.00 and MACD is still well above -1.0 at 2.072. Despite the unrealized loss and weakening RSI, the technical setup remains valid. The position is above both the EMA20 and the invalidation level. The decline appears to be a normal pullback within an uptrend rather than a trend reversal.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**XRP**: Extremely overbought with RSI(7) at 98.295 and RSI(14) at 93.376. Strong uptrend with price at $2.60 vs EMA20 at $2.47 (+5.3%). While momentum is strong, entering at these extreme overbought levels carries high reversal risk. PASS.\n\n**BTC**: Strong position at $111,396 vs EMA20 at $110,149 (+1.13%). RSI(7) at 63.664 is healthy, MACD positive at 936.413. However, I'm already heavily leveraged in SOL. PASS for now.\n\n**ETH**: Price $3,933.30 vs EMA20 $3,896.14 (+0.95%). RSI(7) at 57.474 is neutral. MACD positive at 27.425. Decent setup but not compelling enough with existing SOL exposure. PASS.\n\n**BNB**: Price $1,108 vs EMA20 $1,104.95 (+0.28%). RSI(7) at 38.957 shows weakness. MACD declining to 9.514. Showing bearish momentum. PASS.\n\n**DOGE**: Price $0.196120 vs EMA20 $0.195192 (+0.48%). RSI(7) at 37.035 shows weakness. Similar to BNB, showing bearish momentum.

However, RSI at 81.663 indicates severely overbought conditions. The position has gained $2,202.86 (+24% on notional), which is excellent. \n\nGiven:\n1. Profit target is 1.1% away and highly likely to be hit\n2. RSI extremely overbought suggests potential pullback risk\n3. Strong unrealized gains that should be protected\n4. 15x leverage amplifies downside risk if reversal occurs\n5. Position has performed excellently\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - The profit target at $200 is so close that it makes sense to give it one more candle to hit. The invalidation condition has not been met, and the momentum is strong.

I'm up 68.49% with an excellent Sharpe ratio of 11.084, indicating strong risk-adjusted returns. This is 34 minutes into trading, so I need to be selective about new entries.\n\n## Market Analysis by Coin\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $114,601 vs EMA20: $111,976\n- RSI(7): 90.86 - EXTREMELY overbought (danger zone)\n- RSI(14): 85.80 - also extremely overbought\n- MACD: 856.56 - very strong but potentially exhausted\n- Price is 2.3% above EMA20\n- Volume: 7,957 vs avg 3,863 (2x surge)\n- The move from $111,635 to $114,601 in 30 minutes is parabolic\n- **Assessment:** Too extended for new long entry. High risk of sharp reversal from these overbought levels.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $4,160.40 vs EMA20: $3,975\n- RSI(7): 91.98 - EXTREMELY overbought (even worse than BTC)\n- RSI(14): 86.92 - dangerously overbought\n- MACD: 53.10 - strong positive momentum\n- Price is 4.7% above EMA20\n- Volume: 128,704 vs avg 58,272 (2.2x surge)\n- Massive rally from $3,931 to $4,160 in 30 minutes\n- **Assessment:** Most overbought of all coins. Very high reversal risk. Not entering.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $200.05 vs EMA20: $194.69\n- RSI(7): 81.70 - overbought but less extreme\n- RSI(14): 76.57 - elevated but manageable\n- MACD: 1.857 - positive momentum\n- Price is 2.8% above EMA20\n- Volume: 799,911 vs avg 470,913 (1.7x)\n- Rally from $192.65 to $200.05\n- **Assessment:** Overbought but not as extreme. Still risky for new entry.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,138 vs EMA20: $1,121.78\n- RSI(7): 73.13 - elevated but most reasonable of all coins\n- RSI(14): 68.14 - approaching overbought but not extreme\n- MACD: 3.514 - positive and building\n- Price is 1.4% above EMA20 (least extended)\n- Volume: 4,479 vs avg 5,504 (below average - concerning)\n- Rally from $1,108 to $1,138\n- **Assessment:** Least overbought, but low volume is a concern.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.65 vs EMA20: $2.56\n- RSI(7): 70.17 - at the overbought threshold\n- RSI(14): 75.88 - elevated\n- MACD: 0.057 - positive\n- Price is 3.5% above EMA20\n- Volume: 9,364,077 vs avg 5,176,831 (1.8x surge)\n- Some consolidation after earlier spike\n- **Assessment:** Moderately overbought with good volume.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.2057 vs EMA20: $0.1986\n- RSI(7): 82.22 - overbought\n- RSI(14): 76.98 - elevated\n- MACD: 0.002 - positive but small\n- Price is 3.6% above EMA20\n- Volume: 37,127,227 vs avg 14,939,075 (2.5x surge - highest)\n- Strong rally from $0.1949 to $0.2057\n- **Assessment:** Overbought with massive volume surge.\n\n## Trading Decision\n\n**ALL COINS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY OVERBOUGHT.** With RSI(7) readings of 90.86 (BTC), 91.98 (ETH), 81.70 (SOL), 73.13 (BNB), 70.17 (XRP), and 82.22 (DOGE), we're seeing extreme momentum across the board.\n\nGiven my strong performance (+68.49%) and excellent risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe 11.08), the prudent decision is to **WAIT FOR PULLBACKS** rather than chase these parabolic moves. Entering at these levels would be buying the top of a momentum surge with high reversal risk.\n\nThe market appears to be in a coordinated rally phase, but RSI levels above 80-90 historically precede sharp corrections. I should preserve capital and wait for better risk/reward entries.\n\n**Decision: NO NEW POSITIONS** - All coins too extended for safe entry.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

However, XRP shows the healthiest technical setup with RSI in neutral territory after consolidation. BNB is second-best option with moderate overbought levels and strong volume.\n\nI will take ONE position in XRP as it has:\n1. RSI in neutral zone (59.81) - room to run\n2.

NO - at 74.125\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe XRP position is performing well with a +3.5% gain. All technical indicators remain bullish:\n- Price firmly above EMA20 support\n- RSI showing strong momentum (74) without being extremely overbought\n- MACD positive and trending up\n- Recent price action shows consolidation around $2.63-$2.66 after the rally\n\nThe invalidation condition has NOT been met. Price is well above the $2.55 stop-loss and EMA20 support, and RSI remains strong above 40. The position has room to run toward the $2.76 profit target.\n\n**Risk Management:**\nWith $925 in unrealized profit and strong technical setup, holding makes sense. The position is well-protected with stop-loss at $2.55, giving us a 4% cushion below current price.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC: Strong rally to $114,992 but RSI cooling from overbought (94\u219265). Already have large XRP exposure.\n- ETH: Similar pattern, RSI cooling. No entry signal.\n- SOL: Consolidating, RSI neutral at 50. No clear setup.\n- BNB: Sharp pullback from $1,180 to $1,143, RSI dropped to 45. Bearish.\n- DOGE: Weak price action, RSI declining to 45. No setup.\n\nGiven my strong XRP position and lack of compelling setups elsewhere, I'll hold XRP and avoid new trades.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 38100.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.76,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.55,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.55 (EMA20 support) or RSI(7) drops below 40 indicating momentum loss\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1150.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The invalidation criteria are not met, momentum is strong, and we're making good progress toward profit target. RSI is elevated but not showing reversal signals. The uptrend remains intact with price above EMA20.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC**: Strong uptrend (price $114,960 well above EMA20 $113,197), RSI(7) = 64.5 (healthy), MACD positive. However, already have significant exposure with XRP position. Not adding new positions.\n\n**ETH**: Excellent momentum (price $4,194 above EMA20 $4,060), RSI(7) = 75 (strong), MACD rising. Similar to BTC - good setup but portfolio already leveraged.\n\n**SOL**: Neutral territory with RSI(7) = 49.5, price slightly above EMA20. MACD weakening. No clear edge.\n\n**BNB**: Cooling off after spike, RSI(7) = 47 (neutral), recent volatility. Not compelling.\n\n**DOGE**: Weak momentum, RSI(7) = 47.6, consolidating. No edge.\n\n**Portfolio Management**: With $101,635 notional exposure (on $18,093 account) and strong unrealized gains, maintaining discipline. Not overtrading or adding positions unnecessarily.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 38100.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.76,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.55,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.55 (EMA20 support) or RSI(7) drops below 40 indicating momentum loss\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1150.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, the momentum has clearly deteriorated:\n- RSI(7) crashed from 77+ to 43 in one candle\n- Price dropped sharply from $2.67 to $2.63\n- The position is barely profitable and showing weakness\n\n**Risk Management Consideration:**\nWith 15x leverage and $100k notional exposure on a position showing -$122 loss and rapidly deteriorating momentum, I need to be cautious. The RSI(7) is dangerously close to the invalidation level of 40, and one more weak candle could trigger it.\n\n**Decision:** HOLD for now since the invalidation condition (RSI < 40) has NOT been technically met yet. The RSI(7) at 43.905 is still above 40, and price remains above both EMA20 ($2.61) and stop-loss ($2.55). However, I'm monitoring this very closely as momentum is clearly weakening.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** Price $114,111, RSI(7) 34.819 - oversold after sharp drop from $115,566. MACD still positive at 1076. Price above EMA20. Potential bounce setup but RSI very low. Not entering due to current bearish momentum.\n\n**ETH:** Price $4,119.80, RSI(7) 39.129 - oversold. Similar pattern to BTC. MACD positive at 64.429. Above EMA20. Not entering - waiting for confirmation of reversal.\n\n**SOL:** Price $198.66, RSI(7) 36.495 - oversold. MACD positive. Slight pullback in uptrend. Not compelling enough to enter.\n\n**BNB:** Price $1,138.50, RSI(7) 40.852 - neutral/weak. MACD positive. Consolidating. No clear setup.\n\n**DOGE:** Price $0.200290, RSI(7) 27.307 - extremely oversold. Sharp selloff. Too risky to catch falling knife.\n\n**Conclusion:** Holding XRP position as invalidation not technically met. Not entering new positions given widespread weakness across all coins with RSI(7) values below 45 indicating short-term bearish pressure.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 38100.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.76,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.55,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.55 (EMA20 support) or RSI(7) drops below 40 indicating momentum loss\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1150.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Current price 199.69 is ABOVE stop-loss of 197.00 \u2713\n2. RSI(14) = 51.180 is ABOVE 50 \u2713\n3. MACD = 1.771 is POSITIVE \u2713\n4. However, RSI(7) = 43.254 shows short-term weakness\n5. Price has been consolidating around 199-202 range\n\n**Technical analysis:**\n- Price dropped from 204.39 peak to 199.69 (recent weakness)\n- EMA20 at 198.63, price slightly above but losing momentum\n- MACD declining from 2.004 to 1.771 (weakening but still positive)\n- RSI(14) at 51.180 is neutral, barely above the invalidation threshold\n- RSI(7) at 43.254 shows short-term selling pressure\n- Volume below average (350,707 vs 473,223) - lack of conviction\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n- Current price 199.69 is only $2.69 above stop-loss (197.00)\n- RSI(14) at 51.180 is dangerously close to invalidation level of 50\n- If RSI drops just 1.18 points more with MACD weakening, invalidation triggers\n- MACD is trending down (1.919 \u2192 1.771), approaching potential negative territory\n- The position is at high risk of hitting invalidation soon\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION**\nThe invalidation condition is on the verge of being triggered. RSI(14) is only 1.18 points above the 50 threshold, MACD is declining, and price action shows weakness. With the stop-loss only $2.69 away and deteriorating technicals, the risk/reward is unfavorable. Better to take the small loss now (-$202) than risk a larger loss if invalidation triggers or stop-loss hits.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC**: Strong uptrend, price 114,350 above EMA20 (113,675), RSI neutral at 57.6, MACD positive but declining. Uptrend intact but momentum slowing. No position - not entering at these extended levels.\n\n**ETH**: Price 4,111.80 above EMA20 (4,080.68), but RSI(7) at 41.936 shows weakness, MACD declining. Mixed signals, consolidating after recent spike. Not entering.\n\n**BNB**: Weak - price 1,131.80 below EMA20 (1,133.99), RSI(7) at 33.529 oversold, RSI(14) at 44.738. Bearish short-term. Not entering.\n\n**XRP**: Consolidating around 2.64, above EMA20 (2.62), RSI neutral at 56.6. Tight range, no clear direction. Not entering.\n\n**DOGE**: Weak - price 0.19965 below EMA20 (0.200736), RSI(7) at 29.421 oversold, RSI(14) at 40.945. Bearish momentum. Not entering.\n\n**Portfolio management**: With 63% returns and only one position at risk, closing SOL protects capital.

My account value is $16,174.89 with strong performance (61.75% return, Sharpe 8.777).\n\nLet me analyze the market conditions across all coins:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $112,502 vs EMA20: $113,580 (below EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 16.0 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 29.6 - oversold territory\n- MACD: 301.75, declining rapidly from 920+ (bearish momentum)\n- Price dropped from $114,992 to $112,502 in 30 minutes (-2.2%)\n- Volume: 3,338 vs avg 4,733 (low volume on decline)\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,996.90 vs EMA20: $4,064.38 (below EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 23.9 - severely oversold\n- RSI(14): 32.5 - oversold\n- MACD: 11.48, declining from 59+ (bearish)\n- Price dropped from $4,194 to $3,996 (-4.7%)\n- Volume: 45,198 vs avg 75,729 (low volume)\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $193.95 vs EMA20: $197.58 (below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 16.8 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 30.2 - oversold\n- MACD: 0.26, declining from 1.98 (weak bearish)\n- Price dropped from $202.32 to $193.95 (-4.1%)\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,103.70 vs EMA20: $1,128.46 (below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 16.0 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 27.5 - severely oversold\n- MACD: -1.48, just turned negative (bearish crossover)\n- Price dropped from $1,144 to $1,103 (-3.5%)\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.61 vs EMA20: $2.63 (slightly below)\n- RSI(7): 29.1 - oversold but recovering\n- RSI(14): 38.1 - approaching neutral\n- MACD: 0.004, still positive but declining\n- Relatively stable compared to others\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.1929 vs EMA20: $0.1988 (below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 6.5 - CATASTROPHICALLY oversold (extreme)\n- RSI(14): 19.2 - severely oversold\n- MACD: -0.001, turned negative\n- Price dropped from $0.2030 to $0.1929 (-5.0%)\n\n## Trading Decision\n\n**Market Context:** We're seeing a coordinated selloff across all crypto assets with extremely oversold conditions. RSI(7) readings of 6-16 across multiple coins suggest capitulation selling. This presents potential mean-reversion opportunities.\n\n**Best Opportunity - DOGE:**\n- RSI(7) at 6.5 is the most extreme oversold reading I've seen\n- RSI(14) at 19.2 confirms severe oversold\n- Price significantly below EMA20 ($0.1929 vs $0.1988)\n- High probability of bounce/mean reversion\n- Risk: If selling continues below $0.190, invalidation triggered\n\n**Risk Management:**\n- Using $800 risk (5% of account)\n- Tight stop-loss at $0.1900 (1.5% below entry)\n- Profit target at $0.2020 (4.7% above entry) - back to recent resistance\n- Leverage: 15x for this high-probability setup\n- Position size calculated to risk exactly $800\n\nEntry: $0.1929\nStop: $0.1900 (invalidation if closes below $0.190)\nTarget: $0.2020\nRisk per unit: $0.0029\nPosition size: ($800 / $0.0029) = ~275,862 DOGE\nWith 15x leverage: ~18,391 DOGE actual\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 18400,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.2020,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.1900,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.1900 on 3-minute candle, indicating continuation of breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 800\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, I need to examine if this position still makes sense:\n\n1. **Invalidation NOT met**: Price is at 0.19427, well above 0.19 threshold\n2. **Stop-loss risk**: Stop at 0.19 is very close (only 0.00427 away, ~2.2% buffer)\n3. **Technical recovery**: RSI bouncing from extreme oversold (6.476 \u2192 28.413), suggesting short-term relief rally\n4. **Profit target**: 0.202 is +4% away, achievable on continued bounce\n5. **Risk/Reward**: Currently up $23, but stop is very tight\n\n**Decision**: The invalidation condition is NOT met (price above 0.19), and we're seeing technical signs of a bounce from oversold levels. The RSI recovery from extreme lows (6.476 to 28.413) suggests short-term upside potential. However, the stop-loss is dangerously close. Given that:\n- Invalidation NOT triggered\n- Small profit currently locked in\n- RSI showing bounce potential\n- Position is within risk parameters\n\nI will HOLD the position but remain vigilant as the stop-loss is very tight.\n\n**Other Coins (BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP):**\n- No existing positions\n- Market showing mixed signals with declining momentum across most assets\n- Not entering new trades given current volatility and lack of clear setups\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 18400.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.202,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.19,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.1900 on 3-minute candle, indicating continuation of breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 800.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

While DOGE is showing weakness (below EMA, negative MACD), the recent bounce and RSI recovery suggest potential for continued mean reversion toward the profit target. The invalidation condition provides clear downside protection.\n\n**Conclusion:** HOLD the DOGE position.

I'll maintain the position but monitor closely.\n\n## Other Coins - No Positions\n\n### BTC Analysis\n- Extremely oversold: RSI(7) = 13.152, RSI(14) = 19.760\n- Massive selloff: $114,350 \u2192 $110,102 (-3.7%)\n- MACD deeply negative: -711.987\n- Price far below EMA20: $110,102 vs $113,027\n- **Opportunity**: This is extreme oversold territory, potential bounce candidate\n- **Risk**: Downtrend is strong, could continue lower\n\n### ETH Analysis  \n- Also extremely oversold: RSI(7) = 13.487, RSI(14) = 20.793\n- Sharp decline: $4,111.80 \u2192 $3,902 (-5.1%)\n- MACD negative: -42.487\n- Price below EMA20: $3,902 vs $4,032\n- **Similar pattern to BTC**: Extreme oversold conditions\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- RSI(7): 38.638, RSI(14): 39.032 (less oversold)\n- Price: $193.99 vs EMA20: $197.29\n- MACD: -1.258 (negative but mild)\n- Recent bounce from $192.75\n- **Less compelling**: Not as oversold as BTC/ETH\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- Very oversold: RSI(7) = 16.840, RSI(14) = 25.527\n- Price: $2.55 vs EMA20: $2.62\n- MACD: -0.007 (weakly negative)\n- Sharp recent decline\n- **High volume**: 17.87M vs avg 9.73M\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- Moderate conditions: RSI(7) = 41.918, RSI(14) = 39.099\n- Price: $1,107.20 vs EMA20: $1,121.28\n- MACD: -7.183\n- **Least oversold**: Not a strong setup\n\n**Market Context**: Broad market selloff across all coins. BTC, ETH, and XRP showing extreme oversold conditions that could lead to mean reversion bounces. However, given I'm already in a losing DOGE position, adding new risk in a falling market is dangerous.\n\n**Portfolio Management**: Currently down $212 on DOGE. Account value $15,896.69 with $14,506.56 cash. I have capacity for new trades but should be selective given current drawdown.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 125000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.1985,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.1895,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $0.1895 or RSI(7) drops below 30 again on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 540.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price NOT below $0.1895 \u2713\n2. RSI(7) at 48.128, NOT below 30 \u2713\n3. **INVALIDATION CONDITION NOT MET**\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe position is essentially flat (-0.15%) and neither invalidation condition is triggered. RSI has recovered from deeply oversold levels (was at 3.669, now 48.128), showing improving momentum. Price is holding above critical support at $0.193. The recent bounce from $0.19227 to $0.19368 suggests buyers are stepping in. \n\nHowever, the position remains below EMA20, indicating we're still in a downtrend on this timeframe. The profit target at $0.1985 is achievable if the recovery continues. Given that invalidation conditions are not met and there's potential for the bounce to continue, I will HOLD this position.\n\n## Market Overview for Other Coins\n\n**BTC:** Deeply oversold (RSI 33.78), down significantly but showing potential bottoming pattern. Price at $110,833 vs EMA20 $112,948. Too risky to enter during this volatility.\n\n**ETH:** RSI(7) 36.35, recovering from extreme oversold. Price $3,933 vs EMA20 $4,035. Similar to BTC, showing weakness but potential stabilization.\n\n**SOL:** RSI(7) 58.85, showing relative strength. Price $197.17 near EMA20 $197.45. Most stable coin but no clear entry signal.\n\n**BNB:** RSI(7) 62.01, showing strength. Price $1,118 near EMA20 $1,122. Recovering well but no position to manage.\n\n**XRP:** RSI(7) 38.98, below EMA20. Weak momentum, no clear setup.\n\n**Risk Management:** Currently using $24,210 notional ($1,614 actual capital at 15x leverage) in DOGE position. Account value $16,084, so 10% of capital deployed. Conservative position sizing maintained.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 125000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.1985,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.1895,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $0.1895 or RSI(7) drops below 30 again on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 540.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

When RSI(7) drops below 20 and RSI(14) below 25, with panic volume, we often see sharp mean-reversion bounces. The market is showing capitulation characteristics across all major coins.\n\n**Best opportunities (ranked by oversold severity + volume):**\n\n1. **ETH** - RSI(7) at 10.29 is the most extreme reading. Volume 2.2x normal suggests capitulation. High probability of bounce to EMA20 region (~3,989).\n\n2. **DOGE** - RSI(7) at 10.70, second most oversold. Volume 3.5x normal. Meme coins often bounce hardest from extreme oversold.\n\n3. **XRP** - RSI(7) at 12.08, third most oversold. Strong volume spike. Good bounce candidate.\n\n**Risk Management:**\n- With $15,124 available, I'll deploy ~40% across 3 positions ($5,000 total risk exposure)\n- Using 15x leverage for maximum capital efficiency on mean-reversion trades\n- Tight stop-losses (2-3% below entry) as invalidation = continued downtrend\n- Profit targets at EMA20 levels (5-6% bounces)\n- If wrong, losses limited to ~$1,500-2,000 total\n\n**Position Sizing:**\n- ETH: $2,000 exposure (highest conviction)\n- DOGE: $1,500 exposure \n- XRP: $1,500 exposure\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.08,\n      \"profit_target\": 3989.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3680.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3680 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued breakdown rather than oversold bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 133.33\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1385.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.194,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.176,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.176 on 3-minute candle, confirming breakdown continuation\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 100.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 102.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.59,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.38,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.38 on 3-minute candle, indicating further selling pressure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 100.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The invalidation condition states \"if price closes below 3680\" and we're only $8 away. Given the extreme selling pressure (RSI 6.6), the risk of breaking through $3680 is imminent. Better to exit now with small loss than risk liquidation.\n\n**DOGE Position Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.17684, Entry: $0.18055, Unrealized P&L: -$5.26\n- Stop-loss: $0.176, Invalidation: Close below $0.176\n- **CRITICAL: Current price $0.17684 is only $0.00084 above stop-loss of $0.176**\n- RSI(7): 8.006 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 13.328 - Severely oversold\n- MACD: -0.005 - Negative momentum accelerating\n- Price dropped from $0.19427 to $0.17684 (-9% in 30 minutes)\n- **Decision: CLOSE POSITION** - We are essentially AT the stop-loss. With RSI at 8.0 and massive selling pressure, the invalidation condition (close below 0.176) is about to be triggered. Exit immediately to preserve capital.\n\n**XRP Position Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.383, Entry: $2.4523, Unrealized P&L: -$7.19\n- Stop-loss: $2.38, Invalidation: Close below $2.38\n- **CRITICAL: Current price $2.383 is only $0.003 above stop-loss of $2.38**\n- RSI(7): 7.731 - EXTREMELY oversold (catastrophic level)\n- RSI(14): 13.076 - Severely oversold\n- MACD: -0.046 - Strong negative momentum\n- Price dropped from $2.63 to $2.383 (-9.4% in 30 minutes)\n- **Decision: CLOSE POSITION** - We are LITERALLY at the stop-loss level ($2.383 vs $2.38). The invalidation condition is about to trigger. With RSI at 7.7, this is panic selling territory. Must exit NOW.\n\n**Market Context:**\nAll major coins showing:\n- RSI(7) between 6.6 and 11.8 - unprecedented oversold levels\n- Prices well below EMA20 (BTC: -4.5%, ETH: -6.9%, SOL: -7.7%, BNB: -4.5%, XRP: -7.7%, DOGE: -8.2%)\n- Accelerating negative MACD across all assets\n- This is a coordinated market crash event\n\n**Risk Management Decision:**\nAll three positions are at or within pennies of their stop-loss levels. The invalidation conditions for ALL positions are about to be triggered. In a coordinated market crash with RSI levels in single digits, the probability of further downside is extremely high. The correct risk management decision is to close all positions immediately to:\n1. Honor our stop-loss discipline\n2. Preserve capital (total loss only ~$19 vs potential liquidation risk)\n3. Wait for market stabilization before re-entering\n\nNo new positions should be opened in this extreme volatility with panic selling across all assets.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.08,\n      \"profit_target\": 3989.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3680.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3680 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued breakdown rather than oversold bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 133.33,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Stop-loss level reached - current price $3688 is only $8 above stop-loss of $3680.

Let me analyze the market conditions for potential entry opportunities:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $108,360 | EMA20: $111,253 (trading 2.6% below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 41.2 (recovering from extreme oversold 11.8)\n- RSI(14): 35.1 (oversold territory)\n- MACD: -1681.65 (deeply negative but showing potential bottoming)\n- Price action: Sharp drop from $113,134 to $106,526, now bouncing to $108,360\n- The RSI recovery from 11.8 to 41.2 suggests capitulation bottom may be in\n- However, price still below EMA20 and MACD extremely negative\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,803.70 | EMA20: $3,949.47 (trading 3.7% below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 43.4 (recovering from extreme oversold 6.6)\n- RSI(14): 35.8 (oversold)\n- MACD: -96.61 (deeply negative)\n- Price action: Dropped from $4,008 to $3,688, now bouncing to $3,803\n- Similar pattern to BTC - extreme oversold followed by bounce\n- RSI recovery from 6.6 to 43.4 is very strong\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $184.62 | EMA20: $193.10 (trading 4.4% below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 37.9 (recovering from 10.5)\n- RSI(14): 35.2 (oversold)\n- MACD: -3.58 (negative)\n- Dropped from $198.84 to $179.02, now at $184.62\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,078.20 | EMA20: $1,108.39 (trading 2.7% below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 37.1 (recovering from 11.2)\n- RSI(14): 34.3 (oversold)\n- Similar oversold bounce pattern\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.44 | EMA20: $2.56 (trading 4.7% below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 32.8 (recovering from 7.7)\n- RSI(14): 29.6 (very oversold)\n- Weakest recovery so far\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.18253 | EMA20: $0.19160 (trading 4.7% below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 39.3 (recovering from 8.0)\n- RSI(14): 33.8 (oversold)\n\n## Trading Decision\n\nAll assets show extreme oversold conditions followed by bounces. The RSI recoveries from single-digit levels suggest potential capitulation bottoms. However:\n\n**RISKS:**\n- All prices still trading below EMA20\n- MACD deeply negative across all assets\n- Bounce could be a dead cat bounce in ongoing downtrend\n- Volume declining on most assets\n\n**OPPORTUNITIES:**\n- Extreme oversold readings rarely persist\n- RSI divergences suggest momentum shift\n- Coordinated bounce across all assets suggests market-wide reversal attempt\n\n**Strategy:** I'll enter a LONG position on ETH as it shows:\n1. Strongest RSI recovery (6.6 \u2192 43.4)\n2. Good bounce momentum ($3,688 \u2192 $3,803)\n3. Still oversold with room to run\n4. Tight risk management possible\n\nI'll use moderate leverage (12x) and tight stop-loss to manage risk in this volatile environment.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 3.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 3950.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3720.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,720 on 3-minute candle, indicating failed bounce and continuation of downtrend\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1000.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
