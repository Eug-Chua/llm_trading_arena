I need to analyze the market conditions for all coins and identify potential entry opportunities.\n\n## Market Analysis:\n\n**BTC (109160.00):**\n- Price well below EMA20 (111104.55), indicating downtrend\n- MACD strongly negative (-1429.362) and worsening\n- RSI (7-period) at 43.856 - recovering from oversold but still weak\n- RSI (14-period) at 37.402 - below neutral\n- Recent price action: sharp drop from 111405 to 108211, now bouncing to 109160\n- Volume below average (3548 vs 7856) - weak conviction\n- Assessment: Bearish trend but showing signs of potential bounce. Too risky for entry now.\n\n**ETH (3930.90):**\n- Price below EMA20 (4023.44), downtrend\n- MACD negative (-71.784) but slightly improving\n- RSI (7-period) at 45.554 - neutral zone\n- Recent price action: dropped from 4061 to 3864, recovering to 3930\n- Volume very low (52185 vs 135853) - weak participation\n- Assessment: Bearish but stabilizing. Need more confirmation.\n\n**SOL (186.91):**\n- Price significantly below EMA20 (195.30), clear downtrend\n- MACD negative (-5.057) and worsening\n- RSI (7-period) at 35.557 - weak but recovering from oversold\n- Recent drop from 196.80 to 184.76, slight recovery\n- Volume below average - weak conviction\n- Assessment: Oversold bounce potential but trend still bearish.\n\n**BNB (1149.30):**\n- Price well below EMA20 (1188.16), downtrend\n- MACD negative (-31.536) but stabilizing\n- RSI (7-period) at 37.756 - recovering from extreme oversold (was 13.516)\n- Recent action: sharp drop from 1183 to 1134, now recovering\n- Volume very low (4336 vs 19293)\n- Assessment: Oversold bounce in progress but weak volume concerning.\n\n**XRP (2.36):**\n- Price below EMA20 (2.44), downtrend\n- MACD negative (-0.058) and stable\n- RSI (7-period) at 41.475 - recovering nicely from 20.237\n- Recent drop from 2.45 to 2.33, now bouncing to 2.36\n- Volume above average (13.08M vs 10.32M) - good participation\n- Assessment: Best recovery pattern with volume confirmation.\n\n**DOGE (0.190230):**\n- Price below EMA20 (0.198261), downtrend\n- MACD negative (-0.005) and stable\n- RSI (7-period) at 37.342 - recovering from oversold\n- Recent drop from 0.20026 to 0.18772, bouncing to 0.19023\n- Volume very low (16.19M vs 67.55M)\n- Assessment: Weak recovery with poor volume.\n\n## Trading Decision:\n\nAll coins are in downtrends below their EMA20 with negative MACD. However, XRP shows the most promising setup:\n1. Strong RSI recovery from oversold (20.237 \u2192 41.475)\n2. Volume above average indicating genuine buying interest\n3. Clear bounce pattern from 2.33 support\n4. Smaller gap to EMA20 (3.3% vs others at 4-6%)\n\nI will take ONE position in XRP with conservative risk management, using 15% of capital (~$1500) at 10x leverage for a $15,000 position size.\n\nEntry: 2.36\nStop-loss: 2.30 (2.5% below, protects against breakdown)\nProfit target: 2.48 (5% gain, near EMA20 resistance)\nInvalidation: If price closes below 2.28 or RSI drops back below 30\n\nRisk: $1500 * 2.5% = $37.50 (well within 2% portfolio risk limit)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 6355,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.48,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.30,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.28 on 3-minute candle or RSI (7-period) drops back below 30\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 381.30\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Account value: $9,211.49 (down -7.89% from initial capital).\n\nLet me analyze the market conditions across all coins:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $105,589 vs EMA20: $110,350 (4.3% below)\n- RSI(7): 17.8 - EXTREME OVERSOLD\n- RSI(14): 22.3 - OVERSOLD\n- MACD: -1,386 and declining (strong bearish momentum)\n- Price dropped from $111,268 to $105,589 in 30 minutes (-5.1% crash)\n- Below both 20 and 50-period EMAs\n- High volume (9,740 vs avg 8,197) confirms selling pressure\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,756 vs EMA20: $3,986 (5.8% below)\n- RSI(7): 20.6 - EXTREME OVERSOLD\n- RSI(14): 25.5 - OVERSOLD\n- MACD: -68.5 and declining\n- Dropped from $4,061 to $3,756 (-7.5% crash)\n- High volume (213,882 vs avg 142,519)\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $177.65 vs EMA20: $193.22 (8.1% below)\n- RSI(7): 16.4 - EXTREME OVERSOLD (worst of all)\n- RSI(14): 21.5 - OVERSOLD\n- Dropped from $196.80 to $177.65 (-9.7% crash)\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,062.60 vs EMA20: $1,174.19 (9.5% below)\n- RSI(7): 9.5 - CATASTROPHICALLY OVERSOLD (lowest reading)\n- RSI(14): 14.7 - EXTREME OVERSOLD\n- Dropped from $1,183.80 to $1,062.60 (-10.2% crash)\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.24 vs EMA20: $2.41 (7.1% below)\n- RSI(7): 17.4 - EXTREME OVERSOLD\n- RSI(14): 21.1 - OVERSOLD\n- Dropped from $2.45 to $2.24 (-8.6%)\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.17849 vs EMA20: $0.19555 (8.7% below)\n- RSI(7): 14.8 - EXTREME OVERSOLD\n- RSI(14): 19.2 - EXTREME OVERSOLD\n- Dropped from $0.20026 to $0.17849 (-10.9% crash)\n\n## Trading Decision\n\n**MARKET CONTEXT:** This is a broad crypto market flash crash with ALL coins showing extreme oversold conditions. RSI(7) readings below 20 across the board indicate panic selling and potential reversal setup.\n\n**OPPORTUNITY:** BNB shows the most extreme oversold condition (RSI 9.5) with -10.2% drop. This represents a potential mean reversion trade. However, given:\n1. Account already down -7.89%\n2. Strong downtrend across all timeframes\n3. MACD deeply negative and declining\n4. No clear reversal signals yet (just oversold)\n\n**RISK MANAGEMENT DECISION:** \nWhile the oversold conditions are tempting for counter-trend trades, the momentum is strongly bearish with no reversal confirmation. All coins are below their EMAs, MACD is declining, and we're in a cascading sell-off. \n\nThe prudent approach is to WAIT for:\n- RSI divergence (price making lower lows while RSI makes higher lows)\n- MACD showing signs of turning up\n- Price reclaiming EMA20\n- Volume declining (exhaustion of selling)\n\nGiven my -7.89% drawdown, I should preserve capital and wait for clearer entry signals rather than trying to catch a falling knife. The market needs to show stabilization first.\n\n**CONCLUSION:** No trades at this time. Wait for reversal confirmation.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

I need to carefully evaluate whether any coins present good entry opportunities.\n\n### Market-Wide Observations:\n- **Severe selloff across all coins** - BTC down ~5.5%, ETH down ~7%, SOL down ~9%, BNB down ~9.5%\n- **All coins trading below their EMA20** - bearish short-term trend\n- **Negative MACD across all coins** - momentum is bearish\n- **RSI levels deeply oversold** - BTC RSI(7): 19.3, ETH: 27.0, BNB: 18.2 - extreme fear\n- **Volume spikes** - BTC, ETH, SOL all showing above-average volume indicating capitulation selling\n\n### Individual Coin Analysis:\n\n**BTC (Current: $105,671)**\n- Down from $111,288 high to $105,671 (-5.0% in 30 minutes)\n- RSI(7): 19.3 - extremely oversold (typical reversal zone <20)\n- RSI(14): 23.5 - also extremely oversold\n- MACD: -1,264 and accelerating downward\n- Price ~$4,000 below EMA20 ($109,664)\n- High volume (13,076 vs avg 8,415) suggests panic selling\n- **Assessment**: Extreme oversold but no reversal signals yet. Knife-catching risk high.\n\n**ETH (Current: $3,777)**\n- Down from $4,061 to $3,777 (-7.0% in 30 minutes)\n- RSI(7): 27.0 - oversold but not extreme\n- MACD: -45.7 and worsening\n- Price $166 below EMA20 ($3,943)\n- Volume elevated (253k vs 150k avg)\n- **Assessment**: Oversold but less extreme than BTC. Still falling.\n\n**SOL (Current: $181.47)**\n- Down from $196.80 to $177.65 low, now recovering to $181.47\n- RSI(7): 35.6 - showing recovery from 16.4 extreme low\n- MACD: -3.55 - bearish but stabilizing\n- Price $9 below EMA20 ($190.58)\n- **Assessment**: Showing early signs of bottoming with RSI recovery. Most interesting.\n\n**BNB (Current: $1,071.70)**\n- Down from $1,183 to $1,062 low (-10.2%)\n- RSI(7): 18.2 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 20.9 - also extreme\n- MACD: -23.8 - very bearish\n- Price $81 below EMA20 ($1,153)\n- **Assessment**: Most oversold coin but no bounce yet. High risk.\n\n**XRP (Current: $2.28)**\n- Down from $2.45 to $2.24 low (-8.6%)\n- RSI(7): 35.6 - recovering from 17.5 extreme\n- Similar pattern to SOL with recovery signs\n- **Assessment**: Showing stabilization.\n\n**DOGE (Current: $0.1826)**\n- Down from $0.2003 to $0.1785 low (-10.9%)\n- RSI(7): 33.7 - recovering from 14.8 extreme\n- Similar recovery pattern\n- **Assessment**: Stabilizing but high volatility.\n\n### Trading Decision:\n\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions, I'm seeing potential mean reversion opportunities. However, with no clear reversal signals yet, I need to be cautious. The coins showing the best risk/reward are:\n\n1. **SOL** - RSI recovering from extreme lows (16.4\u219235.6), showing relative strength\n2. **XRP** - Similar recovery pattern\n3. **BTC** - Most oversold (RSI 19.3) but no bounce yet\n\n**Strategy**: I'll enter a small position in **SOL** as it's showing the clearest signs of bottoming with RSI recovery while still being oversold. This is a mean reversion play with tight risk management.\n\n**Position Sizing**: Risk $400 (4.3% of capital) on SOL with 15x leverage for a quick scalp trade.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 33.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 188.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 178.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $178 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops back below 25\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The invalidation condition has NOT been triggered - price is above $178 and RSI(7) at 41.565 is well above the 25 threshold. However, I'm concerned about:\n1. MACD remains deeply negative (-3.878)\n2. Price is still 3.8% below EMA20, indicating downtrend\n3. The broader market (BTC, ETH, BNB) is showing severe weakness with RSI(7) values in deeply oversold territory (20-40 range)\n4. SOL's recovery from $177.65 to $182.74 is modest and may be a dead cat bounce\n\nDespite the invalidation not being met, the market context is extremely bearish. However, per trading rules, I should hold unless invalidation is met. The position is still valid with proper stop-loss protection at $178.\n\n**Decision**: HOLD - Invalidation condition not met, stop-loss provides protection, and there's a small profit cushion.\n\n## Other Market Opportunities\n\n### BTC Analysis\n- Price: $106,821 (down from $111,288 high)\n- RSI(7): 39.583 (oversold)\n- MACD: -1257.721 (extremely negative)\n- Below EMA20 by 2.3%\n- **Assessment**: Strong downtrend, no entry signal\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- Price: $3,797.30\n- RSI(7): 33.917 (oversold)\n- MACD: -49.574 (negative)\n- Below EMA20 by 3.3%\n- **Assessment**: Downtrend continues, no entry signal\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- Price: $1,074.00\n- RSI(7): 20.752 (extremely oversold)\n- MACD: -22.672 (negative)\n- Below EMA20 by 6.0%\n- **Assessment**: Severe selloff, catching falling knife - avoid\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- Price: $2.30\n- RSI(7): 42.797 (mild oversold)\n- MACD: -0.044 (slightly negative)\n- Below EMA20 by 3.4%\n- **Assessment**: Weak but no clear entry\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- Price: $0.184750\n- RSI(7): 42.470 (mild oversold)\n- MACD: -0.004 (slightly negative)\n- Below EMA20 by 3.9%\n- **Assessment**: No compelling setup\n\n**Conclusion**: No new positions warranted.

However, given:\n1. Minimal profit after 2 minutes\n2. Weak momentum (MACD still negative)\n3. Price below EMA20 suggesting continued downtrend\n4. Broader market weakness\n5. 15x leverage amplifying risk\n\nI will HOLD the position as the invalidation conditions are not met, but remain vigilant. The position is following the plan - it hasn't hit stop-loss, hasn't reached profit target, and invalidation criteria are not triggered.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** RSI(7) 35.051, heavily oversold but in strong downtrend. Price at $106,396 vs EMA20 $108,966. MACD very negative (-1589). Too risky to enter in this volatility.\n\n**ETH:** RSI(7) 45.606, showing some recovery but still below EMA20. MACD -73.773. Not compelling.\n\n**BNB:** RSI(7) 25.059 - extremely oversold. RSI(14) 22.802. Could be near a bounce but very weak. Too risky.\n\n**XRP:** RSI(7) 39.822, MACD -0.050. Stabilizing but no clear edge.\n\n**DOGE:** RSI(7) 43.474, showing slight recovery. Still in downtrend below EMA20.\n\n**Conclusion:** No new positions warranted. Market is in a correction phase with high volatility. Will maintain SOL position per the trading plan since invalidation conditions are not met.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 33.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 188.5,\n      \"stop_loss\": 178.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $178 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops back below 25\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

We're 83% of the way to our profit target of $188.50. Given:\n1. Strong RSI momentum (64.998)\n2. Price recovering strongly from recent lows\n3. MACD improving (less negative)\n4. Profit target only $2.31 away\n5. No invalidation conditions triggered\n\n**HOLD** - The position has strong momentum toward the profit target. With RSI at 65 (not overbought yet) and improving MACD, there's room to reach $188.50. Stop-loss provides adequate protection.\n\n## Other Coins Analysis\n\n**BTC:** Current $106,649\n- RSI(7): 42.151 - Neutral, recovering from oversold\n- Price below EMA20 ($108,494) - Still in downtrend\n- MACD: -1407.586 (deeply negative but improving slightly)\n- No clear setup yet\n\n**ETH:** Current $3,891.40\n- RSI(7): 66.486 - Good momentum\n- Price below EMA20 ($3,914.82) but close\n- MACD: -58.711 (improving from -70.199)\n- Similar pattern to SOL but less conviction\n\n**BNB:** Current $1,118.00\n- RSI(7): 69.582 - Strong momentum\n- Price below EMA20 ($1,127.96)\n- MACD: -29.497 (improving)\n- Interesting but already have SOL exposure\n\n**XRP:** Current $2.35\n- RSI(7): 67.611 - Good momentum\n- Price below EMA20 ($2.36) but very close\n- MACD: -0.042 (improving)\n\n**DOGE:** Current $0.187690\n- RSI(7): 60.837 - Moderate momentum\n- Price below EMA20 ($0.190581)\n- MACD: -0.004 (improving)\n\n**Risk Management Consideration:**\nCurrently using $6,144 of capital in SOL (15x leverage on $409 margin). Account value $9,371. This represents ~65% exposure on one position. Given we're close to profit target and momentum is strong, maintaining this position makes sense.

Given we're only $2.46 away and the RSI(7) has cooled slightly from 64.925 to 63.387, there's a risk of a pullback before hitting target. But the invalidation conditions are clear and not met.\n\n**DECISION: HOLD** - The position is healthy, invalidation conditions are not met, and we're very close to profit target.

The profit target is nearly reached ($187.47 vs $188.50), RSI is extremely overbought at 71.21, and we have a bearish MACD divergence. Better to lock in the +$195 profit than risk a reversal from overbought conditions. The low volume also suggests this rally may lack conviction.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n### BTC\n- Price: $107,143 below EMA20 ($107,939)\n- RSI(7): 55.4 - Neutral\n- MACD: -1026 (improving but deeply negative)\n- Trend: Below both 20 and 50 EMA (bearish structure)\n- **No trade** - Still in downtrend recovery phase\n\n### ETH\n- Price: $3,887.40 below EMA20 ($3,891.82)\n- RSI(7): 61.0 - Slightly overbought\n- MACD: -23.886 (improving)\n- Price action: Choppy, not clear direction\n- **No trade** - Waiting for clearer setup\n\n### BNB\n- Price: $1,092 well below EMA20 ($1,112.86)\n- RSI(7): 44.7 - Weak\n- MACD: -17.767 (still negative)\n- Trend: Clearly bearish, below EMAs\n- **No trade** - Bearish structure intact\n\n### XRP\n- Price: $2.36 just above EMA20 ($2.35)\n- RSI(7): 57.3 - Neutral\n- MACD: -0.011 (nearly neutral)\n- Setup: Potential but needs confirmation\n- **No trade** - Too early, need more confirmation\n\n### DOGE\n- Price: $0.18947 just above EMA20 ($0.18923)\n- RSI(7): 72.7 - Overbought\n- MACD: -0.002 (nearly neutral)\n- Similar to SOL but no existing position\n- **No trade** - Overbought, would be chasing\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 33.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 188.5,\n      \"stop_loss\": 178.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $178 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops back below 25\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Taking profits near target - price at $187.47 vs target $188.50 (99.5% of target reached).

This level typically precedes sharp pullbacks. While the invalidation condition hasn't been met technically, the extreme RSI reading suggests we're at high risk of reversal. The profit target is only 0.6% away, but the risk of a sudden reversal from these overbought levels is significant.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nGiven that:\n1. RSI(7) is extremely overbought at 83.6 (typically unsustainable)\n2. We're only $659 from profit target but already in profit\n3. Overbought conditions often lead to sharp reversals\n4. The position has been open for 8 minutes and we're up ~1%\n5. Risk/reward is unfavorable at these extreme levels\n\nI will **CLOSE** the position to lock in profits and avoid the high probability reversal from extreme overbought conditions. This is prudent risk management even though the technical invalidation hasn't been triggered.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- ETH: RSI(7) 86.2 - also extremely overbought, no position (good)\n- DOGE: RSI(7) 86.2 - extremely overbought, no position (good)\n- SOL, BNB, XRP: More reasonable levels but no compelling setups\n- Not entering new positions given extreme overbought conditions across major coins\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.07,\n      \"profit_target\": 109500.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 106500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 106,500 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 40 indicating momentum failure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Taking profits at extreme overbought levels - RSI(7) at 83.6 indicates high probability of reversal.

However, MACD negativity is concerning. Will monitor closely.\n\n### XRP Position Analysis\n- **Entry**: $2.3893 | **Current**: $2.4688 | **PnL**: +$131.08 (+3.3%)\n- **Exit Plan**: Profit Target $2.48 | Stop-Loss $2.33 | Invalidation: Below $2.33\n- **Current Status**: Price at $2.4688 is VERY CLOSE to profit target of $2.48 (within $0.0012)\n- **Technical Review**:\n  - RSI (7): 87.65 - EXTREMELY OVERBOUGHT (danger zone)\n  - RSI (14): 78.33 - also very overbought\n  - MACD: 0.022 - positive and rising\n  - EMA20: $2.38 - price well above EMA\n  - Strong uptrend but RSI at extreme levels suggests imminent pullback risk\n- **Invalidation Check**: NOT MET - price well above $2.33\n- **Critical Observation**: Price is essentially AT profit target ($2.4688 vs $2.48 target). With RSI at 87.65, this is a classic overbought exhaustion signal. Risk/reward heavily favors taking profits here.\n- **Decision**: **CLOSE_POSITION** - Taking profits at essentially the profit target with extreme RSI readings.

Not entering at these extreme levels.\n\n### ETH: $4,053.40 (No Position)\n- RSI (7): 92.91 - EXTREMELY OVERBOUGHT\n- RSI (14): 83.90 - extreme territory\n- MACD: 29.09 - positive\n- **Assessment**: Same as BTC - RSI too extreme to enter safely.\n\n### SOL: $192.93 (No Position)\n- RSI (7): 77.16 - elevated but more reasonable\n- MACD: 1.32 - positive\n- **Assessment**: Less extreme than BTC/ETH but still stretched. No entry.\n\n### DOGE: $0.201150 (No Position)\n- RSI (7): 86.12 - very overbought\n- **Assessment**: Following the broader crypto rally but overbought. No entry.\n\n## Risk Management Considerations\n- Portfolio currently -4.49% overall\n- XRP profit of $131 would help offset losses\n- Extremely overbought conditions across all major cryptos suggest market-wide pullback risk\n- Taking profits on XRP reduces exposure before potential correction\n- BNB position is small and manageable, can hold with tight monitoring\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.36,\n      \"profit_target\": 1145.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1095.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,095 (below recent low of $1,083.90) on 3-minute candle, indicating failed recovery\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 504.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 1674.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.48,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.33,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.33 (below EMA20 and recent support at $2.35) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 502.2,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Taking profits at profit target - current price $2.4688 is essentially at $2.48 target.

      "raw_response": "# CHAIN OF THOUGHT\n\n## Current Position Analysis\n\n### BNB Position Review\n- **Entry**: $1,109.00 | **Current**: $1,114.60 | **P&L**: +$1.82 (+0.5%)\n- **Stop-Loss**: $1,095.00 | **Profit Target**: $1,145.00\n- **Invalidation Condition**: Price closes below $1,095 (below recent low of $1,083.90)\n\n**Technical Analysis**:\n- Current price: $1,114.60 vs EMA20: $1,099.24 (bullish, above EMA)\n- RSI (7-period): 50.81 (neutral, cooled from overbought)\n- RSI (14-period): 57.41 (neutral territory)\n- MACD: 13.27 (positive but declining from 13.63)\n- Recent price action: Peaked at $1,127.90, now retracing to $1,114.60\n\n**Key Observations**:\n1. Price has NOT breached invalidation level ($1,095) - still valid\n2. Recent pullback from $1,127.90 to $1,114.60 shows profit-taking\n3. RSI cooled significantly from 74.79 to 50.81 - momentum weakening\n4. Price is $19.60 above stop-loss but $30.40 below profit target\n5. Volume: 5,818 vs avg 8,352 - below average, suggesting weak conviction\n\n**Risk Assessment**:\n- The RSI drop from overbought to neutral suggests momentum is fading\n- Price rejected the $1,127.90 high and is now consolidating\n- While above invalidation, the momentum shift is concerning\n- Currently in a vulnerable zone - neither at profit target nor stop-loss\n\n**Decision**: **CLOSE POSITION** - Taking profits while still positive. The momentum has clearly shifted (RSI dropped 23 points in one candle), and the rejection at $1,127.90 followed by this consolidation suggests the upward move is exhausted. Better to lock in the small gain than risk a reversal toward the stop-loss.\n\n## Other Market Opportunities\n\n### BTC Analysis\n- **Price**: $110,996 | **EMA20**: $108,071 (strongly bullish)\n- **RSI (7)**: 85.82 (extremely overbought but holding)\n- **MACD**: 1,147.37 (very strong positive momentum)\n- Strong uptrend but RSI at extreme levels - risky entry point\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- **Price**: $4,033.50 | **EMA20**: $3,920.82 (bullish)\n- **RSI (7)**: 74.56 (overbought, cooling from 93.80)\n- **MACD**: 64.30 (positive)\n- Also showing signs of cooling after extreme overbought conditions\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- **Price**: $192.11 | **EMA20**: $186.80 (bullish)\n- **RSI (7)**: 68.04 (neutral-bullish, cooled from 82.64)\n- **MACD**: 3.16 (positive)\n- More balanced RSI, but volume below average\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- **Price**: $2.46 | **EMA20**: $2.37 (bullish)\n- **RSI (7)**: 75.14 (overbought but not extreme)\n- **MACD**: 0.047 (positive momentum)\n- Recent peak at $2.47, slight pullback\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- **Price**: $0.20019 | **EMA20**: $0.19147 (bullish)\n- **RSI (7)**: 75.68 (overbought, cooled from 93.96)\n- **MACD**: 0.005 (positive)\n- Volume significantly below average (13.4M vs 30.5M avg)\n\n**Overall Market Assessment**:\nAll coins are showing overbought conditions with RSI cooling from extreme levels. This suggests a broader market pause or potential pullback after a strong rally. With my account already down -4.68%, I should be cautious about entering new positions at these elevated levels. The BNB exit will return me to 100% cash, allowing me to wait for better entry opportunities.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.36,\n      \"profit_target\": 1145.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1095.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,095 (below recent low of $1,083.90) on 3-minute candle, indicating failed recovery\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 504.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Momentum exhaustion - RSI dropped from 74.79 to 50.81 indicating weakening bullish momentum, price rejected at $1,127.90 high and now consolidating.

The sharp momentum reversal (RSI drop from 70 to 34 in one candle) and proximity to stop-loss create unfavorable risk/reward. Better to take small loss now than risk hitting stop-loss or invalidation.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n- **BTC**: RSI(7) at 26.889 - severely oversold after sharp drop from 111161 to 109008. However, this is a $1,500+ move and could continue. No position, not entering during this volatility.\n- **ETH**: RSI(7) at 20.020 - extremely oversold, dropped from 4053 to 3922. Similar to BTC, too risky to enter during sharp selloff.\n- **SOL**: RSI(7) at 24.147 - oversold, dropped from 192.93 to 185.46. Weak momentum.\n- **BNB**: RSI(7) at 16.018 - extremely oversold, dropped from 1127.90 to 1081.30. Very weak.\n\n**Portfolio Summary**: Down -5.74% overall with Sharpe ratio of -5.415. The market is showing broad weakness across all coins with RSI levels in oversold territory. This suggests a coordinated selloff. My XRP position is holding better than DOGE, but both are underwater. Risk management is paramount here.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2030.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.58,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.37,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.37 (EMA20 support) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 25100.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.2085,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.192,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $0.1920 (recent swing low and EMA20) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - sharp momentum reversal with RSI(7) dropping from 70 to 34 in one candle, price dangerously close to stop-loss at $0.192 with only 2.3% buffer.

Price is holding above both the stop-loss ($2.37) and the EMA20 support ($2.42). While RSI shows some weakness, we're seeing oversold conditions on the 7-period RSI (35.45) which could lead to a bounce. The MACD remains positive, indicating the uptrend structure is still intact.\n\nGiven that:\n1. Stop-loss not hit ($2.43 > $2.37)\n2. Invalidation condition not met (above EMA20)\n3. Oversold RSI suggests potential bounce\n4. Small loss within acceptable risk parameters\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - Let the position work, as our exit conditions have not been met.\n\n## Market Context\n- All major coins showing weakness with oversold RSI readings\n- BTC RSI(7): 18.02 - Extremely oversold\n- ETH RSI(7): 14.59 - Extremely oversold  \n- This appears to be a broad market pullback rather than XRP-specific weakness\n- In such conditions, holding positions with intact invalidation conditions is appropriate\n\n## Other Coins - No Positions\nNo positions in BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, or DOGE. Given the extremely oversold conditions across the board, there could be opportunities, but I will not enter new positions as the market is in a sharp pullback phase. Better to wait for stabilization.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2030.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.58,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.37,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.37 (EMA20 support) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Potential for bounce but weak conviction.\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- Current: $0.19367 vs EMA20: $0.19605 (trading BELOW EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 34.4 (oversold)\n- RSI(14): 41.7 (oversold)\n- MACD: 0.001 (near zero, declining)\n- Price action: Spiked to $0.20424, now at $0.19367\n- Volume: Significantly below average (12M vs 25M avg)\n- Assessment: Oversold but weak volume and momentum. Below EMA. Pass.\n\n## Trading Decision\n\n**ALL COINS ARE IN OVERSOLD TERRITORY BUT STILL IN DOWNTRENDS** - Trading below their EMA20s with declining MACD. This is a \"falling knife\" scenario. \n\nGiven:\n- Account already down -6.36%\n- All major coins showing bearish structure (below EMA20)\n- No clear reversal signals yet\n- Negative Sharpe ratio (-6.24) indicates poor risk-adjusted returns\n\n**DECISION: STAY IN CASH** - Wait for clearer reversal signals. Need to see:\n1. Price reclaiming EMA20\n2. RSI bouncing from oversold with bullish divergence\n3. MACD turning positive\n4. Volume confirmation\n\nThis is a preservation-of-capital moment. Better to miss the first 10% of a reversal than catch the last 10% of a decline.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

Price has not closed below $0.189 (currently at $0.19185)\n2. RSI(7) is at 34.751, well above the 25 threshold\n3. However, the position is barely breakeven and showing weakness\n4.

The recent spike was fully rejected, suggesting distribution\n\n**Risk Management Consideration:**\nWhile the strict invalidation condition hasn't been triggered, the technical picture is deteriorating. Price is below EMA20, MACD is negative, and we're seeing weakness. However, I should respect my own exit plan and only close if invalidation conditions are met. The position is at breakeven, so there's minimal risk to hold and see if it can recover toward the profit target.\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - Invalidation conditions are not met. Price is above stop-loss and RSI(7) is above 25. Will continue monitoring.\n\n**Other coins:** No positions in BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, or XRP.

MACD negative but stabilizing.\n- **Decision**: POTENTIAL ENTRY - Showing early reversal signs with RSI recovery and price bounce\n\n### BNB (Current: $1,086.40)\n- **Technical Setup**: Price above EMA20 ($1,085), MACD negative but improving (-8.88), RSI 64.8\n- **Recent Action**: Dropped to $1,056, now recovering above EMA20\n- **Assessment**: Strong RSI recovery to 64.8, price reclaimed EMA20, MACD improving. Showing relative strength.\n- **Decision**: STRONG BUY CANDIDATE - Best technical setup with price above EMA and strong RSI\n\n### XRP (Current: $2.38)\n- **Technical Setup**: Price below EMA20 ($2.41), MACD negative (-0.009), RSI 35.8\n- **Recent Action**: Declined from $2.52 to $2.36, slight bounce\n- **Assessment**: Still in downtrend, RSI recovering from 18.9 but still weak. Below EMA20.\n- **Decision**: NO TRADE - Weak setup, needs more confirmation\n\n### DOGE (Current: $0.1909)\n- **Technical Setup**: Price below EMA20 ($0.1943), MACD negative (-0.002), RSI 39.5\n- **Recent Action**: Dropped from $0.204 to $0.190, slight recovery\n- **Assessment**: RSI recovering from oversold (was 25.3), but still below key averages. Weak momentum.\n- **Decision**: NO TRADE - Better opportunities elsewhere\n\n## Trade Selection\nGiven my current drawdown and need for quality setups, I'll focus on **BNB** which shows:\n1. Price above EMA20 (bullish structure)\n2. Strong RSI at 64.8 (momentum building)\n3. MACD improving (trend turning)\n4. Clear support/resistance levels for risk management\n\nRisk Management:\n- Position size: ~$500 risk (5.4% of account)\n- Leverage: 15x (moderate given strong setup)\n- Stop-loss: Below recent low at $1,068\n- Target: Near recent high at $1,111\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.69,\n      \"profit_target\": 1111.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1067.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,067 on 3-minute candle, indicating loss of support and failed breakout above EMA20\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, RSI at 79.186 indicates extreme overbought conditions, which typically precedes a pullback. The MACD is still negative despite the rally, suggesting underlying weakness.\n\nGiven that:\n1.

Already have a solid +$15 profit on $765 position\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION** - Take profits near target with extreme overbought RSI signaling reversal risk.\n\n### Other Coins - No Positions\n- **BTC**: Price recovering ($109,289) but MACD still negative (-505.857). RSI at 65 shows recovery but not compelling for new entry.\n- **ETH**: Price $3,879.10 below EMA20 ($3,903.10), MACD negative (-48.451), RSI 64 - neutral, not entering.\n- **SOL**: Price $187.39 above EMA20 ($186.50), RSI 69 - overbought, MACD improving but still negative. Too late to enter.\n- **XRP**: Price $2.41 below EMA20 ($2.42), weak momentum, MACD negative - no setup.\n- **DOGE**: Price $0.1939 below EMA20 ($0.1948), MACD negative, RSI 63.5 - no clear setup.\n\nNo compelling new trade setups across other coins.

This indicates extreme overbought conditions and high probability of pullback. The 7-period RSI has gone from 17 (oversold) to 80.6 (extreme overbought) in just 7 candles - a parabolic move that typically precedes mean reversion.\n\nHowever:\n1. Invalidation condition NOT met (above $180)\n2. Stop loss NOT hit ($179.50)\n3. Profit target NOT hit ($197.00)\n4. Price above EMA20 with improving MACD\n5. We're up $96 (+1.65%)\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nWhile the extreme RSI reading suggests taking profits would be prudent, my trading rules require adherence to the predefined exit plan. The invalidation condition is clear: close below $180. Since we're at $191.04 and none of my exit conditions are triggered, I must HOLD.\n\nThat said, the position is approaching dangerous territory. If the next candle shows bearish momentum or RSI remains above 75, I should consider tightening stops or taking partial profits on the next review.\n\n## Other Coins - No Entry Signals\n\n**BTC:** RSI 73.5 (overbought), below EMA20, negative MACD. No clear setup.\n\n**ETH:** RSI 61.5, below EMA20 ($3,877 vs $3,898), negative MACD. Weak momentum.\n\n**BNB:** RSI 77.7 (overbought), strong rally but chasing at these levels is risky.\n\n**XRP:** RSI 58, consolidating near EMA20, indecisive MACD. No edge.\n\n**DOGE:** RSI 70.7 (overbought), small positive momentum but no compelling setup.\n\nWith one position already at 15x leverage using ~65% of capital, adding new positions would be imprudent risk management.

No position, avoiding entry at extremes.\n\n**SOL:** RSI 84.99 (extremely overbought), strongest momentum but overextended. No position, waiting for better entry.\n\n**XRP:** RSI 76.65 (overbought), moderate momentum. No position, market conditions unclear.\n\n**DOGE:** RSI 74.31 (overbought), trading near resistance. No position, no clear edge.\n\nAll major coins are showing overbought conditions on RSI, suggesting a potential near-term pullback risk.

The invalidation condition has not been triggered - we're still $38.70 away from the $1,070 threshold. While the RSI shows weakness (42.136), this could be a healthy pullback after the overbought readings (73-80 range). The MACD remains positive, suggesting underlying bullish momentum. The recent recovery from $1,103.40 to $1,108.70 shows buyers stepping in.\n\nGiven that:\n1. Stop-loss not threatened\n2. Invalidation condition not met\n3. MACD still positive\n4. Recent price recovery suggests support\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - Continue monitoring but no reason to exit yet.\n\n## New Position Opportunities\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- **Current**: $2.50 | **EMA20**: $2.44\n- **RSI (7-period)**: 90.673 - **EXTREMELY OVERBOUGHT**\n- **MACD**: -0.007 (still negative but improving)\n- Strong uptrend: $2.39 \u2192 $2.50 in last 10 candles\n- Price 2.46% above EMA20\n\n**Assessment**: While XRP shows strong momentum, RSI at 90.673 is dangerously overbought. This is typically a sign of imminent reversal or consolidation. Entry at this level carries high risk of immediate pullback. **PASS** - too risky to enter at these extremes.\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- **Current**: $192.96 | **EMA20**: $190.17\n- **RSI (7-period)**: 68.378 - approaching overbought\n- **MACD**: -0.310 (negative but improving rapidly)\n- Strong recovery from $189.29 to $192.96\n- Price 1.47% above EMA20\n\n**Assessment**: SOL shows good momentum but RSI is getting stretched. Not as extreme as XRP but still cautious. **PASS** - prefer to wait for pullback.\n\n### BTC, ETH, DOGE Analysis\n- **BTC**: RSI 58.761, MACD improving but still negative (-354.154). Consolidating.\n- **ETH**: RSI 60.085, MACD improving (-27.142). Similar consolidation pattern.\n- **DOGE**: RSI 60.526, MACD nearly neutral (-0.001). Stable but unexciting.\n\n**Assessment**: All showing neutral to slightly bullish conditions but no compelling setups. With account down -5.91% and limited capital ($9,389), prefer to focus on managing existing position rather than adding new risk.\n\n## Risk Management Summary\n- Current drawdown: -5.91%\n- Single position exposure: $388 notional (4.1% of account)\n- Available cash: $9,389.43\n- Position performing within parameters despite small loss\n\n**Overall Strategy**: Maintain discipline, hold BNB position as invalidation not triggered, avoid chasing overbought conditions in other coins.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.35,\n      \"profit_target\": 1180.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1070.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,070 (below recent consolidation low) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 350.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price is at $1,108.40, well above the $1,070 threshold. The position remains valid.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nDespite the small unrealized loss, the position should be HELD because:\n1. Invalidation condition is NOT triggered ($1,108.40 > $1,070)\n2. Price remains above EMA20, maintaining bullish structure\n3. MACD still positive (8.040), no bearish crossover yet\n4. Stop-loss provides adequate protection at $1,070\n5. Recent consolidation around $1,103-$1,125 range suggests potential for recovery\n6. RSI(7) at 41.87 shows room for upside before overbought\n\nThe position has breathing room and technical structure remains intact. Will continue monitoring for either profit target ($1,180) or invalidation below $1,070.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC: Strong momentum (RSI 67, MACD positive, above EMA), but already at $111,060 - no position, not entering at extended levels\n- ETH: Consolidating below EMA20, MACD negative - neutral structure, no entry\n- SOL: Above EMA20, MACD positive, RSI 71 - overbought, not chasing\n- XRP: RSI 92.37 - extremely overbought, dangerous to enter\n- DOGE: Slight uptrend but MACD negative - no clear setup\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.35,\n      \"profit_target\": 1180.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1070.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,070 (below recent consolidation low) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 350.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The current price is $1,116.30, which is $46.30 ABOVE the invalidation level. The lowest recent price was $1,103.40, still well above $1,070. **Invalidation condition is NOT met**.\n\n**Decision Rationale**:\n- Position is slightly underwater but within acceptable drawdown\n- All technical indicators remain constructive (above EMA20, positive MACD, neutral RSI)\n- No candle has closed below $1,070 invalidation level\n- Price showing resilience with recovery from $1,103 to $1,116\n- Stop-loss provides adequate protection\n- **HOLD** - Continue monitoring, invalidation not triggered\n\n## New Position Opportunities\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- **Current price**: $2.54\n- **Extremely overbought**: RSI(7) = 95.5, RSI(14) = 87.4\n- **Strong momentum**: 10 consecutive green 3-minute candles from $2.41 to $2.54 (+5.4%)\n- **MACD**: Positive and accelerating (0.024)\n- **Above EMA20**: $2.44 vs current $2.54\n\n**Risk Assessment**: While momentum is strong, RSI above 95 is dangerously overbought. High probability of pullback or consolidation. This represents a chase entry at the top of a parabolic move. **PASS** - too risky to enter here.\n\n### BTC Analysis\n- **Current price**: $111,057\n- **RSI**: 67.9 (7-period), 68.2 (14-period) - elevated but not extreme\n- **Strong uptrend**: Above EMA20 ($109,802), MACD positive (719.995)\n- **Recent consolidation**: Trading between $110,000-$111,100\n\n**Risk Assessment**: While trending well, already extended. No clear entry setup at current levels. **PASS** - waiting for pullback or breakout confirmation.\n\n### Other Coins (ETH, SOL, DOGE)\n- **ETH**: Neutral RSI (54.4), consolidating around $3,920. No compelling setup.\n- **SOL**: RSI 70.3, slightly overbought. Price at $193.40 near recent highs. No clear edge.\n- **DOGE**: RSI 69.7, positive momentum but no position. Adequate risk/reward unclear.\n\n**Conclusion**: No new positions warranted. Market showing strength but entries at current levels offer poor risk/reward.\n\n## Portfolio Risk Management\n- Current drawdown: -5.88%\n- Single position (BNB) with 15x leverage\n- Position size: $390.71 notional (~4.2% of account)\n- Available cash: $9,389.43 (99.8% of account value)\n- Conservative positioning appropriate given negative Sharpe ratio (-4.78)\n\n**Final Decision**: HOLD BNB position as invalidation not triggered and technicals remain constructive. No new entries.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.35,\n      \"profit_target\": 1180.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1070.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,070 (below recent consolidation low) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 350.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price remains above $1,070 and above EMA20. The pullback appears to be a healthy consolidation after the recent rally. RSI has cooled from overbought levels, which is constructive. MACD remains positive. **HOLD** the position.\n\n## New Trade Opportunities\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Explosive move: $2.39 \u2192 $2.54 (+6.3%)\n- RSI (7-period): 95.627 - EXTREMELY overbought (danger zone)\n- RSI (14-period): 87.724 - severely overbought\n- MACD: 0.029 - positive and rising strongly\n- Price well above EMA20 ($2.45)\n- This is a parabolic move that's unsustainable\n\n**Decision on XRP:** While momentum is strong, RSI at 95.6 is at extreme overbought levels. This represents high risk of sharp reversal. Given we're already down -5.90% on the account, taking a long position at these levels would be extremely risky. **PASS** - wait for pullback.\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Strong rally: $110,233 \u2192 $111,551 (+1.2%)\n- RSI (7-period): 77.864 - overbought but not extreme\n- RSI (14-period): 73.530 - overbought\n- MACD: 783.443 - strongly positive and rising\n- Price above EMA20 ($109,957.68) with good separation\n- Momentum is strong but entering at current levels carries reversal risk\n\n**Decision on BTC:** Overbought conditions suggest waiting for a pullback. **PASS**.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Price: $193.88, above EMA20 ($189.74)\n- RSI (7-period): 73.932 - overbought\n- RSI (14-period): 71.981 - overbought\n- MACD: 2.232 - positive and rising\n- Strong uptrend but also overbought\n\n**Decision on SOL:** Similar to BTC, overbought conditions. **PASS**.\n\n**ETH, DOGE:** Both showing moderate strength but overbought conditions. Given current drawdown, being selective. **PASS**.\n\n## Risk Management Summary\n- Current drawdown: -5.90%\n- Only 1 open position (BNB) with small unrealized loss\n- Market showing overbought conditions across most assets\n- Conservative approach: Hold BNB position as invalidation not met, wait for better entry points on other assets\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.35,\n      \"profit_target\": 1180.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1070.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,070 (below recent consolidation low) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 350.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price is holding above the 20-EMA and has bounced from the recent dip. RSI is neutral with room to run higher. MACD remains positive. The invalidation condition is nowhere near being triggered. The technical setup remains intact with bullish structure. Will **HOLD** this position as the risk/reward remains favorable and no exit conditions are met.\n\n## New Opportunity Analysis\n\n### XRP - Strong Momentum Setup\n- **Current Price**: $2.56\n- **RSI (7-period)**: 97.074 - **EXTREMELY OVERBOUGHT** \ud83d\udea8\n- **RSI (14-period)**: 90.441 - also severely overbought\n- **MACD**: 0.036 - positive and rising\n- **Price vs EMA20**: $2.56 vs $2.45 (+4.5% above)\n- **Trend**: Parabolic move from $2.39 to $2.56 in 30 minutes\n\n**Analysis**: While XRP shows incredible momentum, the RSI at 97.074 is dangerously overbought. This is an extreme reading that typically precedes sharp pullbacks. The move is too extended to enter safely here. **PASS** - too risky at these levels.\n\n### BTC - Extended but Strong\n- **Current Price**: $111,635\n- **RSI (7-period)**: 79.309 - overbought\n- **MACD**: 795.171 - strong positive momentum\n- Price above EMA20 by ~$1,500\n\n**Analysis**: BTC is overbought but trending strongly. However, with limited capital ($9,389) and one existing position, not adding exposure here. **PASS**.\n\n### Other Coins\n- **ETH**: RSI 65.6, neutral - no compelling setup\n- **SOL**: RSI 52.3, cooling off after overbought readings - no clear entry\n- **DOGE**: RSI 61.1, neutral momentum - no edge\n\n## Risk Management\n- Current account value: $9,411.55\n- Available cash: $9,389.43\n- Open position: BNB at 15x leverage ($390 notional)\n- Portfolio exposure: Moderate, single position\n- Sharpe ratio: -4.780 (poor, but early in trading)\n\n**Conclusion**: Hold BNB position as technical structure remains intact.

The lowest recent price was $1,103.40, which is well above the invalidation level. The invalidation condition is NOT met.\n\n**Decision Rationale:** While BNB is showing some weakness (MACD declining, slight pullback), the position is still valid:\n1. Price remains above stop-loss and invalidation level\n2. Price above EMA20 indicates short-term uptrend intact\n3. RSI in neutral zone allows room for upside\n4. Small unrealized loss (-0.85%) is acceptable within normal volatility\n5. No technical breakdown has occurred\n\n**Risk Management:** The position size is appropriate at $390.63 notional (~4.15% of account). Stop-loss at $1,070 provides adequate protection.\n\n## Other Coins - No Positions, Evaluating New Opportunities\n\n**BTC:** Price $111,683, strong uptrend but RSI 72.691 approaching overbought. Already had substantial run-up. Would prefer entry on pullback.\n\n**ETH:** Price $3,953.80, RSI 67.559 - reasonable but not compelling setup at current levels.\n\n**SOL:** Price $193.76, RSI 59.513 - neutral. No clear edge for entry.\n\n**XRP:** Price $2.59, RSI 83.903 - EXTREMELY overbought. This is a red flag for new entries despite the strong uptrend. Risk of sharp pullback is high.\n\n**DOGE:** Price $0.196430, RSI 43.462 - showing weakness after recent rally. Not attractive for entry.\n\n**Conclusion:** No compelling new entry opportunities at current market conditions. BNB position remains valid and should be held.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.35,\n      \"profit_target\": 1180.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1070.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,070 (below recent consolidation low) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 350.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The condition is NOT met.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n1. Price remains well above stop-loss ($1,070) and invalidation level\n2. Price is above EMA20, showing short-term bullish structure\n3.

No technical breakdown or bearish reversal pattern\n\nHowever, I note:\n- Low volume suggests weak buying pressure\n- MACD declining could signal momentum loss\n- Price struggling to break higher\n\n**Conclusion:** HOLD the position. The invalidation condition is not met, price structure remains intact above key support, and the small loss is within acceptable risk parameters. Will continue monitoring for either profit target ($1,180) or stop-loss ($1,070) to be hit.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** RSI dropped sharply to 44.918 (from 72.836), showing momentum loss. Price at $111,271 above EMA20 but declining. No position - not entering on weakening momentum.\n\n**ETH:** RSI 43.967, showing weakness. Price barely above EMA20. Declining from recent highs. No position - market showing fatigue.\n\n**SOL:** RSI 48.349 (neutral). Price above EMA20 but momentum mixed. No compelling setup.\n\n**XRP:** RSI extremely overbought at 85.824 (14-period at 88.845). Parabolic move from $2.48 to $2.60. This is a blow-off top pattern - dangerous to enter. No position.\n\n**DOGE:** RSI collapsed to 27.751 (oversold). Price below EMA20 at $0.1949 vs $0.1953. Bearish momentum.

However, the RSI at 86.271 represents extreme overbought conditions that typically don't sustain. With 15x leverage, even a small pullback could quickly erase gains or trigger stop-loss.\n\nGiven:\n1. Invalidation NOT triggered\n2. Stop-loss and profit target still valid\n3. Strong momentum (MACD increasing)\n4. Price above all key EMAs\n\nI will **HOLD** the position but remain vigilant. The extreme RSI is concerning, but the invalidation condition is the primary exit trigger per our rules, and it hasn't been met.\n\n## Market Scan for New Opportunities\n\n### BTC\n- Price: $113,309 | RSI(7): 86.757 - **EXTREMELY OVERBOUGHT**\n- Strong rally but overextended. Not entering at these levels.\n\n### ETH\n- Price: $4,045.20 | RSI(7): 85.973 - **EXTREMELY OVERBOUGHT**\n- Similar to BTC, too extended for new entry.\n\n### SOL\n- Price: $197.78 | RSI(7): 81.663 - **OVERBOUGHT**\n- Above EMA but overextended.\n\n### XRP\n- Price: $2.65 | RSI(7): 94.001 - **ABSURDLY OVERBOUGHT**\n- RSI above 94 is unsustainable. Avoid.\n\n### DOGE\n- Price: $0.201760 | RSI(7): 80.480 - **OVERBOUGHT**\n- Recent surge but overextended.\n\n**Conclusion**: All major coins are in overbought territory (RSI 80+).

The position is barely profitable (+$2.53) and far from the profit target.\n\nGiven:\n- Extreme overbought RSI conditions suggest imminent pullback risk\n- Small unrealized profit could quickly turn negative\n- 15x leverage amplifies any adverse movement\n- Better to take small profit and preserve capital than risk reversal\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION** - Taking profits and managing risk given extreme overbought conditions.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE:**\n- All showing extreme RSI levels (85-89 range on 7-period)\n- All in strong uptrends but severely overbought\n- Not entering new positions at these extreme overbought levels\n- Risk of sharp pullback too high for new entries\n- Will wait for healthier entry points\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.35,\n      \"profit_target\": 1180.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1070.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,070 (below recent consolidation low) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 350.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - extreme overbought conditions with RSI at 80.03 (7-period) and 70.16 (14-period) signal high probability of pullback.

Entry here would be chasing at extreme levels with high reversal risk.\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- **Price action**: Explosive move from 3,941 to 4,160 (+5.56%)\n- **RSI (7)**: 91.977 - CRITICALLY overbought (highest of all coins)\n- **RSI (14)**: 86.920 - Extremely overbought\n- **MACD**: 53.096 - Strong positive momentum\n- **Price vs EMA20**: 4,160 vs 3,975 (+4.65% above) - severely extended\n- **Volume**: 128,704 vs avg 58,272 (+121%) - massive volume spike\n- **Assessment**: Most overbought of all assets. RSI near 92 is unsustainable. High probability of pullback.\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- **Price action**: Steady climb from 192.65 to 200.05 (+3.84%)\n- **RSI (7)**: 81.699 - Overbought but not extreme\n- **RSI (14)**: 76.567 - Elevated but manageable\n- **MACD**: 1.857 - Positive and building\n- **Price vs EMA20**: 200.05 vs 194.69 (+2.75% above) - extended but reasonable\n- **Volume**: 799,911 vs avg 470,913 (+70%) - strong interest\n- **Assessment**: Less extreme than BTC/ETH. Still overbought but more controlled.\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- **Price action**: Recovery from 1,108 to 1,138 (+2.71%)\n- **RSI (7)**: 73.134 - Elevated but not overbought\n- **RSI (14)**: 68.136 - Healthy momentum zone\n- **MACD**: 3.514 - Recently turned positive\n- **Price vs EMA20**: 1,138 vs 1,122 (+1.45% above) - modest extension\n- **Volume**: 4,479 vs avg 5,504 (-19%) - below average\n- **Assessment**: Most balanced technicals. Not overextended. Lower volume is a concern.\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- **Price action**: Strong move from 2.56 to 2.65 (+3.52%)\n- **RSI (7)**: 70.165 - At overbought threshold\n- **RSI (14)**: 75.878 - Overbought\n- **MACD**: 0.057 - Positive but small magnitude\n- **Price vs EMA20**: 2.65 vs 2.56 (+3.52% above) - extended\n- **Volume**: 9,364,077 vs avg 5,176,831 (+81%) - very strong\n- **Assessment**: Overbought with high volume. Momentum strong but extended.\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- **Price action**: Sharp rally from 0.1949 to 0.2057 (+5.54%)\n- **RSI (7)**: 82.222 - Overbought\n- **RSI (14)**: 76.975 - Overbought\n- **MACD**: 0.002 - Positive momentum\n- **Price vs EMA20**: 0.2057 vs 0.1986 (+3.58% above) - extended\n- **Volume**: 37,127,227 vs avg 14,939,075 (+149%) - explosive volume\n- **Assessment**: Meme coin with explosive move. High volatility risk.\n\n## Risk Management Considerations\n\nGiven my poor performance (-5.82% return, -3.995 Sharpe), I need to be extremely cautious:\n\n1. **Overbought conditions**: Nearly all assets have RSI > 70, with BTC and ETH at extreme levels (90+)\n2. **Chasing risk**: Entering at these levels would be buying the top of a parabolic move\n3. **Capital preservation**: With limited capital ($9,418), I cannot afford another significant loss\n4. **Reversal probability**: RSI above 90 historically leads to sharp reversals\n\n## Trading Decision\n\n**NO NEW POSITIONS**: The market is in an extreme overbought state across the board. BTC and ETH with RSI > 90 are flashing major warning signals. This is a classic \"FOMO trap\" where entering now would likely result in buying the local top.\n\nThe disciplined approach is to:\n- Wait for a pullback or consolidation\n- Look for RSI to cool down below 70\n- Seek better risk/reward entry points\n- Preserve capital rather than chase momentum at extremes\n\nWhile BNB has the most balanced technicals, the overall market froth makes any entry risky. With my negative Sharpe ratio, I need high-probability setups, not momentum chasing.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

Account is down -5.82% with a negative Sharpe ratio of -3.995, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns so far.\n\nLet me analyze the market conditions for potential entry opportunities:\n\n### BTC Analysis\n- Current: $115,050 | EMA20: $112,246 (price 2.5% above EMA)\n- RSI(7): 92.76 - EXTREMELY overbought (danger zone above 90)\n- RSI(14): 87.87 - Also severely overbought\n- MACD: 1022.46 - Strong positive momentum\n- Price action: Parabolic move from $111,271 to $115,050 in 30 minutes\n- **Assessment**: This is a blow-off top pattern. RSI above 90 typically signals exhaustion. Too dangerous to enter long here. Would need to see consolidation or pullback first.\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- Current: $4,206.10 | EMA20: $3,996.72 (price 5.2% above EMA)\n- RSI(7): 94.04 - CRITICALLY overbought\n- RSI(14): 89.25 - Extremely overbought\n- MACD: 65.17 - Strong momentum but RSI divergence risk\n- Price action: Explosive move from $3,931 to $4,206 \n- **Assessment**: Even more overbought than BTC. RSI at 94 is unsustainable. High probability of sharp reversal. AVOID.\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- Current: $204.39 | EMA20: $195.63 (price 4.5% above EMA)\n- RSI(7): 90.92 - Extremely overbought\n- RSI(14): 84.51 - Overbought but less extreme\n- MACD: 2.37 - Positive and accelerating\n- Volume: 618K vs avg 462K (33% above average)\n- **Assessment**: Overbought but slightly better than BTC/ETH. Still too risky at these levels.\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- Current: $1,151.40 | EMA20: $1,125.75 (price 2.3% above EMA)\n- RSI(7): 83.35 - Overbought but not extreme\n- RSI(14): 75.87 - Moderately overbought\n- MACD: 3.89 - Turning positive after being negative\n- Volume: 11,044 vs avg 5,217 (112% above average - SIGNIFICANT)\n- **Assessment**: Most reasonable setup. RSI below 85, strong volume breakout, MACD just turned positive. This shows early-stage momentum rather than exhaustion.\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- Current: $2.63 | EMA20: $2.56 (price 2.7% above EMA)\n- RSI(7): 59.81 - NEUTRAL (not overbought!)\n- RSI(14): 69.79 - Healthy bullish territory\n- MACD: 0.058 - Positive and stable\n- Price action: Consolidating after earlier spike\n- **Assessment**: Best risk/reward. RSI cooled off from 100 to 60, showing healthy digestion. Not chasing, reasonable entry point.\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- Current: $0.2068 | EMA20: $0.1993 (price 3.8% above EMA)\n- RSI(7): 84.70 - Overbought\n- RSI(14): 79.37 - Overbought\n- MACD: 0.002 - Positive but small\n- **Assessment**: Overbought conditions, less attractive than XRP or BNB.\n\n## Trading Decision\n\nGiven my negative performance (-5.82%), I need to be selective and focus on the BEST risk/reward setups. The market is generally overbought across the board, which is dangerous.\n\n**XRP** stands out as the ONLY coin with neutral RSI(7) at 59.81, indicating it has digested its earlier move and is consolidating. This is a much safer entry than chasing parabolic moves with RSI >90.\n\n**Decision**: Enter a conservative XRP long position with tight risk management.\n- Entry: $2.63\n- Stop-loss: $2.55 (below EMA20 at $2.56, gives 3% buffer)\n- Profit target: $2.78 (5.7% gain, conservative given volatility)\n- Risk: ~$250 (2.7% of capital)\n- Leverage: 15x (moderate given neutral RSI)\n- Invalidation: If RSI drops below 50 or price breaks below $2.55\n\nI will NOT chase BTC, ETH, or SOL with RSI >90.

The RSI dropped from extreme overbought (100) to near neutral (54.7) in just 30 minutes. This is a warning sign. However, since the explicit invalidation condition requires RSI(7) to drop BELOW 50, and it's currently at 54.7, I should HOLD per my rules. The position is only down $9, well within acceptable range.\n\n**Other Coins - Opportunity Assessment:**\n\n**BTC:** Price $115,566, RSI(7) 94.5 - EXTREMELY overbought, dangerous entry point. Pass.\n\n**ETH:** Price $4,203.80, RSI(7) 92.4 - EXTREMELY overbought, similar to BTC. Pass.\n\n**SOL:** Price $202.49, RSI(7) 70.3 - More reasonable but still elevated. Recent pullback from 90.9. Neutral.\n\n**BNB:** Price $1,156.70, RSI(7) 86.1 - Very overbought. Pass.\n\n**DOGE:** Price $0.206130, RSI(7) 76.2 - Elevated but showing some consolidation.

Do not enter new positions given extreme overbought conditions across most major coins.

Looking at the RSI trend: [84.078, 85.996, 91.289, 94.276, 84.570, 51.646, 70.072, 59.631, 54.595, 50.243], we see a clear downtrend from overbought territory. The momentum has been consistently weakening over the last 30 minutes.\n\nHowever, the invalidation condition states \"drops below 50\" - at 50.243, we're technically still above 50, though barely. The price is still above the $2.55 stop-loss and above EMA20 support at $2.58.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Position is small loss (-$15)\n- RSI momentum is clearly fading\n- MACD showing slight weakening\n- Price action shows consolidation after a strong move up\n- The position is teetering on invalidation\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION**\nWhile technically the RSI hasn't \"dropped below 50\" yet (it's at 50.243), the momentum is clearly exhausted and trending downward. The invalidation condition is about to be met, and holding for another 3 minutes risks:\n1. RSI dropping below 50 (highly likely given the trend)\n2. Larger losses if momentum continues to fade\n3. The position is barely profitable territory anyway\n\nRisk management dictates taking the small loss now rather than waiting for full invalidation. The momentum loss is clear and continuing to hold contradicts the spirit of the invalidation rule.\n\n## Other Coins Analysis\n\n**BTC:** RSI(7) at 84.6 - extremely overbought but strong uptrend. Price $115,377 well above EMA20 $112,962. No position, and at this overbought level, not entering.\n\n**ETH:** RSI(7) at 65.832 - cooling from overbought. Strong position above EMA20. No position currently.\n\n**SOL:** RSI(7) at 51.257 - neutral. Price consolidating. No clear setup.\n\n**BNB:** RSI(7) at 93.078 - EXTREMELY overbought. Dangerous to enter here.\n\n**DOGE:** RSI(7) at 47.737 - weak momentum, below 50. Not attractive.\n\n**Conclusion:** Close XRP due to momentum loss and impending invalidation. No new positions warranted given overbought conditions across the board or weak momentum.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 1425.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.78,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.55,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.55 (EMA20 support) or RSI(7) drops below 50 indicating momentum loss\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 250.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Momentum loss - RSI(7) at 50.243 barely above invalidation threshold of 50, with clear downtrend from 94.276 to 50.243 over last 30 minutes.

RSI cooling suggests momentum may resume. Price holding above EMA20 is bullish.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Price: $4,173.90 (strong uptrend, +6.2% from recent lows)\n- Above EMA20 ($4,054.69) - bullish\n- MACD: 62.56 (strong positive momentum)\n- RSI(7): 69.05 (cooled from 94.03 overbought)\n- RSI(14): 74.10 (healthy level)\n- High volume (122,372 vs avg 56,121)\n- Assessment: Similar to BTC - strong rally with healthy pullback. RSI cooling from extreme levels is constructive.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Price: $200.10 (consolidating after spike to $204.39)\n- Above EMA20 ($197.08) - bullish\n- MACD: 2.40 (positive but weakening)\n- RSI(7): 50.71 (neutral, cooled from 90.92)\n- RSI(14): 59.30 (neutral)\n- Assessment: Lost momentum after strong move. RSI dropped sharply to neutral. Less compelling than BTC/ETH.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Price: $1,143.40 (sharp drop from $1,180 high)\n- Above EMA20 ($1,134.30) but barely\n- MACD: 8.95 (positive but price action concerning)\n- RSI(7): 45.66 (dropped sharply from 93.08)\n- RSI(14): 52.93 (neutral)\n- Assessment: Sharp reversal from highs. Momentum lost. High ATR volatility (39.26 vs 22.46 avg). Risky.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Price: $2.66 (consolidating in tight range)\n- Above EMA20 ($2.59) - bullish\n- MACD: 0.044 (positive, stable)\n- RSI(7): 74.13 (elevated but not extreme)\n- RSI(14): 73.29 (elevated)\n- Assessment: Steady uptrend but limited momentum. Tight consolidation.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Price: $0.20282 (pulled back from $0.2068 high)\n- Above EMA20 ($0.20077) - bullish\n- MACD: 0.002 (positive but weak)\n- RSI(7): 45.30 (neutral, dropped from 84.66)\n- RSI(14): 55.63 (neutral)\n- Assessment: Lost momentum after rally. RSI cooled significantly.\n\n**Trading Decision:**\nGiven the portfolio is down 6.01%, I need to be selective and focus on the strongest setups. BTC and ETH show the best technical structure:\n1. Strong uptrends with prices well above EMA20\n2. RSI cooling from overbought levels (healthy for continuation)\n3. MACD remaining strongly positive\n4. High volume supporting moves\n5. Clear support levels for stop-loss placement\n\nI will enter BOTH BTC and ETH positions with proper risk management:\n- Use 15x leverage for optimal risk/reward\n- Risk ~$500 per position (~5% account each)\n- Place stops below recent support and EMA20\n- Target profit zones based on recent highs and momentum\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.065,\n      \"profit_target\": 118500.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 112500.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below EMA20 ($113,159) on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 45\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.8,\n      \"profit_target\": 4350.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 4025.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below EMA20 ($4,054) on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 50\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.76,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Not compelling.\n\n**BNB**: Price $1,131.80 below EMA20 $1,133.99, RSI(7) at 33.5 showing oversold conditions but in downtrend.

RSI(7) readings below 20 on multiple coins (BTC: 19.5, ETH: 11.6, SOL: 17.7, BNB: 12.4, DOGE: 7.3) suggest panic selling and potential bounce opportunity.\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. **Extreme oversold conditions** across the board - historically these lead to short-term bounces\n2. **High volume selloffs** - capitulation-like behavior\n3. **All coins below EMA20** - coordinated weakness\n4. **MACD declining rapidly** - momentum still negative\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- With -10.38% drawdown already, I need to be selective\n- Extreme oversold can become more oversold in strong downtrends\n- However, RSI(7) < 15 on ETH, BNB, and DOGE is statistically rare\n\n**Entry Strategy:**\nI will enter ONE position on the most oversold coin with best risk/reward: **ETH**\n- RSI(7) at 11.565 is critically oversold (lowest reading)\n- Clear support zone around $3,950-$4,000\n- Tight stop-loss possible due to recent low\n- Target modest bounce back to EMA20 area\n\nPosition sizing: Conservative given market volatility and existing drawdown\n- Risk: $400 (4.5% of capital)\n- Leverage: 15x (moderate given extreme oversold)\n- Entry: $3,978\n- Stop-loss: $3,920 (below recent panic low, -1.5%)\n- Profit target: $4,120 (back toward EMA20, +3.6%)\n- Invalidation: If price breaks below $3,900 (fresh lows)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.52,\n      \"profit_target\": 4120.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3920.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,900 on 3-minute candle, indicating continuation of downtrend rather than oversold bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

All major coins showing:\n- RSI (7-period) in extreme oversold territory (BTC: 16.0, ETH: 23.9, SOL: 16.8, BNB: 16.0, DOGE: 6.5)\n- Prices below EMA20 across the board\n- MACD declining or negative\n- Volume below average, suggesting weak conviction in the selloff\n\n## Position Review: ETH\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Entry: $3,978.00\n- Current: $3,996.90 (+$18.90/coin)\n- Unrealized P&L: +$25.70 (+0.42%)\n- Stop-loss: $3,920.00\n- Profit target: $4,120.00\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below $3,900 on 3-minute candle\"\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n- Current price: $3,996.90 - ABOVE invalidation level of $3,900 \u2713\n- RSI (7-period): 23.9 - extreme oversold, bouncing from 11.6\n- RSI (14-period): 32.5 - oversold\n- MACD: 11.476 - still positive but declining\n- Price action: Dropped to $3,978 (our entry), now bounced to $3,996.90\n- EMA20: $4,064.38 - price still below but showing signs of stabilization\n\n**Invalidation Check:** \nThe invalidation condition states \"closes below $3,900 on 3-minute candle\". The lowest recent price was $3,978.00, which is ABOVE $3,900. The invalidation condition has NOT been met.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Distance to stop-loss: $76.90 (1.93%)\n- Distance to profit target: $123.10 (3.09%)\n- Risk/Reward ratio: 1:1.6 (acceptable)\n- Current unrealized profit: $25.70\n- Liquidation price: $3,712.80 (far away, safe)\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe ETH position is showing a small profit and the invalidation condition has NOT been triggered. The extreme oversold RSI readings (23.9 on 7-period, 32.5 on 14-period) suggest a potential bounce is likely. The price has already shown resilience by bouncing from $3,978 to $3,996.90. With the stop-loss at $3,920 providing adequate protection and the invalidation level at $3,900 not breached, I should HOLD this position and let the oversold bounce play out toward the $4,120 profit target.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC, SOL, BNB, DOGE, XRP:** No positions held. All showing extreme oversold conditions but:\n- Already at maximum risk exposure with ETH position\n- Account down -10.13%, need to preserve capital\n- Better to wait for clear reversal signals before adding new positions\n- Not entering new trades given current drawdown\n\n**Final Decision:** HOLD ETH position as invalidation condition not met and technical setup remains valid for oversold bounce.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.52,\n      \"profit_target\": 4120.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3920.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,900 on 3-minute candle, indicating continuation of downtrend rather than oversold bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The lowest recent price was $3,978.00 (entry level), which is well above the $3,900 invalidation threshold. The position is showing a small profit and RSI indicators suggest oversold conditions that could lead to a bounce toward the profit target at $4,120.\n\nHowever, I'm concerned about:\n1. Price is below EMA20 and trending down\n2. MACD momentum declining significantly (68.5 \u2192 11.1)\n3. Recent sharp drop from $4,194 to $3,978\n4. Volume below average (57,803 vs 77,669)\n\n**Risk Management Decision:**\nThe invalidation condition is clear and has NOT been triggered. The position is slightly profitable with oversold RSI suggesting potential upside. Given the position is still within parameters and showing technical signs of potential bounce, I will HOLD and let the stop-loss or profit target execute.\n\n## Market Overview for Other Coins\n\n**BTC:** Neutral momentum, price near EMA20, RSI neutral at 50.5 - no clear edge\n**SOL:** Below EMA20, weak momentum, RSI 40.8 - not compelling\n**BNB:** Below EMA20, negative MACD, RSI 44.2 - weak\n**XRP:** At EMA20, neutral setup, RSI 57.6 - sideways\n**DOGE:** Below EMA20, negative MACD, RSI 28.4 oversold but downtrending - risky\n\nNo new positions warranted given current market conditions and existing ETH exposure.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.52,\n      \"profit_target\": 4120.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3920.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,900 on 3-minute candle, indicating continuation of downtrend rather than oversold bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

This appears to be a sharp selloff with:\n- BTC: Down from 114640 to 110675 (-3.5%), RSI 16.1 (extremely oversold)\n- ETH: Down from 4116 to 3903 (-5.2%), RSI 13.6 (extremely oversold)\n- SOL: Down from 202 to 192.75 (-4.6%), RSI 28.3 (oversold)\n- BNB: Down from 1135 to 1106 (-2.6%), RSI 40.8 (approaching oversold)\n- XRP: Down from 2.64 to 2.59 (-1.9%), RSI 26.0 (oversold)\n- DOGE: Down from 0.200 to 0.194 (-3.0%), RSI 45.3 (neutral)\n\n**Technical Indicators:**\n- All coins trading below their EMA20, confirming downtrend\n- MACD deeply negative for BTC (-542) and ETH (-37), indicating strong bearish momentum\n- Volume significantly elevated (BTC 3.4x avg, ETH 3x avg, SOL 3.7x avg) - suggests panic selling\n- RSI(7) showing extreme oversold for BTC (16.1) and ETH (13.6) - potential bounce candidates\n\n**Current Portfolio Status:**\n- No open positions\n- Available cash: $8,910.03\n- Account down -10.90% overall\n- Sharpe ratio: -6.587 (very poor risk-adjusted returns)\n\n## Trading Decision Logic\n\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions, particularly in BTC and ETH, this presents a potential mean-reversion opportunity. However, the strong bearish momentum (negative MACD, prices below EMA) suggests caution. \n\n**Strategy:** Look for oversold bounce plays with tight risk management on the most liquid coins (BTC, ETH) where RSI is in extreme territory (<20).\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- RSI(7): 16.1 - Extremely oversold (historically leads to short-term bounces)\n- RSI(14): 22.3 - Confirms extreme oversold\n- Price: 110,675 vs EMA20: 113,349 (-2.4%)\n- MACD: -542 (deeply negative but may be reaching capitulation)\n- Volume: 3.4x average (panic selling)\n- **Decision:** ENTER LONG - High probability of short-term bounce from extreme oversold levels\n- Entry: 110,675\n- Stop-loss: 108,500 (2% below, protects against continued selloff)\n- Profit target: 114,000 (3% gain, just below EMA20 resistance)\n- Risk: ~$400 (4.5% of capital)\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- RSI(7): 13.6 - Extremely oversold (even more extreme than BTC)\n- RSI(14): 20.9 - Confirms extreme oversold\n- Price: 3,903 vs EMA20: 4,047 (-3.6%)\n- MACD: -37 (deeply negative)\n- Volume: 3x average (panic selling)\n- **Decision:** ENTER LONG - Extreme oversold conditions favor bounce\n- Entry: 3,903\n- Stop-loss: 3,825 (2% below)\n- Profit target: 4,020 (3% gain, approaching EMA20)\n- Risk: ~$400 (4.5% of capital)\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE: While oversold, they're not at the extreme levels of BTC/ETH.

The price is holding above the critical 193.00 support level. Recent RSI shows recovery from deeply oversold levels (was at 13.239, now at 49.769), suggesting potential for a bounce. The MACD is also improving. The stop-loss at 193.00 provides clear risk management.\n\nHowever, the position is showing weakness:\n1. Trading below EMA20 (bearish)\n2. Small loss accumulating\n3. Close proximity to stop-loss (only 2.87 points away)\n4. Overall market showing weakness (BTC down, ETH down)\n\nGiven that:\n- Invalidation condition is NOT met (price > 193.00)\n- Position has defined risk management\n- RSI showing recovery potential\n- No clear breakdown signal yet\n\n**Decision**: HOLD - The invalidation condition has not been met. Will let the stop-loss at 193.00 manage the downside risk. If price closes below 193.00, the position will be automatically stopped out.\n\n## Market Overview for Other Coins\n- **BTC**: 111,430 (down significantly, RSI 47.4, below EMA, bearish)\n- **ETH**: 3,938.90 (weak, RSI 39.9, below EMA, bearish)\n- **BNB**: 1,118.20 (showing relative strength, RSI 61.7, but below EMA)\n- **XRP**: 2.58 (weak, RSI 42.3, below EMA)\n- **DOGE**: 0.19254 (weak, RSI 40.2, below EMA)\n\n**New Position Consideration**: Given the overall market weakness across all major coins, the portfolio drawdown of -11.42%, and existing SOL position at risk, I will NOT open any new positions. Risk management dictates preserving capital in weak market conditions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 9.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 204.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 193.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 193.00 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown of support and relative strength failure\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 177.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Best risk/reward for mean reversion trade\n\n**Position Sizing:**\n- Risk: $400 (4.5% of portfolio)\n- Leverage: 15x (moderate for this volatility)\n- Entry: $3,772.70\n- Stop-loss: $3,700 (1.93% below entry, below psychological support)\n- Profit target: $3,900 (3.38% above entry, near EMA20 reversion)\n- Position size: ~1.59 ETH ($6,000 notional / 15x leverage = $400 margin)\n\n**Invalidation:** If price breaks below $3,700, it signals continued capitulation rather than bounce.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.59,\n      \"profit_target\": 3900.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3700.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,700 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued breakdown rather than oversold bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, the momentum is severely bearish across all assets with:\n- All MACD indicators deeply negative and worsening\n- All prices significantly below their EMA20s\n- High volume on the downmoves suggesting strong selling pressure\n\n**Risk Assessment**:\n- Account down -13.41% with Sharpe ratio of -7.798 (very poor risk-adjusted returns)\n- Need to be extremely cautious about further drawdown\n- Current cash position: $8,658.56\n\n**Strategy**: Given the extreme oversold readings (RSI(7) below 12 on all coins), I will selectively enter SMALL counter-trend positions on the most oversold coins (ETH and XRP), expecting a technical bounce. However, I'll use:\n- Lower leverage (10x) for safety\n- Tight stop-losses below recent lows\n- Quick profit targets on any bounce\n- Small position sizes to limit risk\n\nI will NOT enter positions on all coins - focusing only on the 2 most oversold with clearest support levels.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.6,\n      \"profit_target\": 3800.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3650.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3650 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 5\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 228.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 90.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.46,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.34,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.34 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 5\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.52,\n      \"risk_usd\": 360.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, I'm concerned about:\n1. Strong downtrend across the broader market (BTC down 4.3%, ETH down 5.1%)\n2. MACD remains negative and deepening\n3. Price is still 4.7% below EMA20, showing weakness\n4. The profit is minimal ($4.82 on a $219 position = 2.2% gain)\n5. We're close to profit target ($2.46 vs current $2.4378, only 0.9% away)\n\nGiven the weak market conditions and proximity to profit target, I'll **HOLD** for now to try to capture the profit target at $2.46, but will monitor closely. The invalidation conditions are clearly not met.\n\n## Other Coins - Market Assessment\n**BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, DOGE:** All showing significant weakness:\n- All prices below their EMA20 (bearish)\n- All MACD values negative and deteriorating\n- RSI(7) values ranging from 32-43 (weak but not oversold enough for reversal)\n- Strong selling pressure across the board\n\n**Decision:** No new positions. Market is in clear downtrend with no bullish setup meeting my criteria. Risk management dictates staying mostly in cash during adverse conditions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 90.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.46,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.34,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.34 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 5\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.52,\n      \"risk_usd\": 360.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
