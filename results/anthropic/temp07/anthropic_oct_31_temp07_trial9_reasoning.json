I need to analyze the market conditions across all coins to identify potential entry opportunities.\n\n## Market Overview Analysis\n\n**BTC (109160.00):**\n- Price well below EMA20 (111104.55) - bearish short-term\n- MACD deeply negative (-1429.362) and still declining\n- RSI(7) at 43.856 - recovering from oversold but not yet strong\n- RSI(14) at 37.402 - still in bearish territory\n- Recent action: Sharp drop from 111405 to 108211, now bouncing to 109160\n- Price below both 20 and 50 EMA on 4H timeframe (bearish structure)\n- Volume below average (3548 vs 7856) - weak conviction\n- Assessment: In downtrend with potential dead cat bounce. Too risky for entry.\n\n**ETH (3930.90):**\n- Price below EMA20 (4023.44) - bearish\n- MACD negative (-71.784) but showing slight improvement\n- RSI(7) at 45.554 - neutral, recovering from oversold\n- RSI(14) at 39.958 - below 50, bearish bias\n- Recent action: Drop from 4061 to 3864, bouncing to 3930\n- Similar pattern to BTC - potential bounce in downtrend\n- Volume very low (52185 vs 135853) - 38% of average\n- Assessment: Weak bounce, not enough conviction for entry.\n\n**SOL (186.91):**\n- Price significantly below EMA20 (195.30) - bearish\n- MACD negative (-5.057) and declining\n- RSI(7) at 35.557 - weak, recovering from deeply oversold (19.011)\n- RSI(14) at 32.649 - oversold territory\n- Recent action: Sharp drop from 196.80 to 184.76, slight recovery\n- Volume very low (464414 vs 1197511) - only 39% of average\n- Assessment: In downtrend with weak bounce. Not attractive.\n\n**BNB (1149.30):**\n- Price well below EMA20 (1188.16) - bearish\n- MACD negative (-31.536) but stabilizing\n- RSI(7) at 37.756 - weak but improving from 13.516\n- RSI(14) at 32.619 - oversold\n- Recent action: Drop from 1183 to 1134, minor recovery\n- Volume extremely low (4336 vs 19293) - only 22% of average\n- Assessment: Weakest volume of all coins. Avoid.\n\n**XRP (2.36):**\n- Price below EMA20 (2.44) - bearish\n- MACD negative (-0.058) and declining\n- RSI(7) at 41.475 - neutral, recovering nicely from 20.307\n- RSI(14) at 35.063 - still oversold but improving\n- Recent action: Drop from 2.45 to 2.33, bouncing to 2.36\n- Volume ABOVE average (13076200 vs 10321690) - 127% of average\n- Assessment: Best volume profile, showing some strength in recovery.\n\n**DOGE (0.190230):**\n- Price below EMA20 (0.198261) - bearish\n- MACD negative (-0.005) and declining\n- RSI(7) at 37.342 - weak but recovering from 18.498\n- RSI(14) at 32.667 - oversold\n- Recent action: Drop from 0.200260 to 0.187720, recovering\n- Volume very low (16194734 vs 67545594) - only 24% of average\n- Assessment: Weak volume, not attractive.\n\n## Trading Decision\n\nAll coins are in short-term downtrends with prices below their EMAs and negative MACD readings. Most have extremely low volume suggesting lack of conviction. The recent bounces appear to be weak relief rallies rather than trend reversals.\n\n**However, XRP stands out:**\n- Only coin with above-average volume (127%)\n- RSI recovering from deeply oversold levels\n- Showing relative strength in bounce (from 2.33 to 2.36)\n- Volume suggests institutional interest/accumulation\n\n**Risk Management Approach:**\nGiven this is the first trade and market conditions are generally bearish, I'll take a conservative position in XRP with:\n- Moderate leverage (12x) for risk control\n- Tight stop-loss to protect capital\n- Risk approximately 3% of capital ($300)\n- Clear invalidation condition\n\nEntry at 2.36 with stop at 2.28 (3.4% below) and target at 2.52 (6.8% above) gives a 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1060,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.52,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.28,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.28 on 3-minute candle or RSI(14) drops back below 30 indicating failed bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 300\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Volume is elevated across the board, confirming the selloff is genuine.\n\n## Position Review\n\n### BTC Position Analysis\n- **Entry**: 105589, **Current**: 105671 (+0.08%, +$1.75 PnL)\n- **Stop-loss**: 103000, **Profit target**: 109500\n- **Invalidation condition**: \"If price closes below 103,000\"\n- **Current status**: Price is at 105671, well above stop-loss at 103000\n- **Technical analysis**: \n  - RSI(7) at 19.3 shows extreme oversold conditions (typically bounce territory)\n  - Price is holding above entry after initial dip to 105589\n  - However, MACD is deeply negative (-1264) showing strong bearish momentum\n  - Price is 3.6% below EMA20 (109664)\n- **Decision**: The invalidation condition has NOT been met (price hasn't closed below 103000). However, the market momentum is extremely bearish with MACD at -1264 and price far below EMA20. The position is barely profitable (+$1.75). Given the extreme bearish conditions and the fact that we're only 1 minute into trading with limited capital, I should **CLOSE** this position to preserve capital. The bounce thesis is not materializing - instead we're seeing continued weakness.\n\n### SOL Position Analysis\n- **Entry**: 177.65, **Current**: 181.47 (+2.1%, +$93.28 PnL)\n- **Stop-loss**: 172.0, **Profit target**: 188.0\n- **Invalidation condition**: \"If price closes below 172\"\n- **Current status**: Price at 181.47, well above stop-loss at 172\n- **Technical analysis**:\n  - RSI(7) at 35.6 shows oversold but recovering\n  - Price bounced from 177.65 low to 181.47 (+2.1%)\n  - MACD negative but less severe than BTC (-3.6)\n  - Still 4.8% below EMA20 (190.58)\n  - This is our best performer with $93 unrealized profit\n- **Decision**: The invalidation condition has NOT been met. SOL is showing relative strength compared to other assets and has bounced nicely from entry. However, given the broader market weakness and the fact that we're in a severe downturn, I should **TAKE PROFITS** here. We're up 2.1% with $93 profit - this is a good exit point before the market potentially turns lower again.\n\n## New Position Opportunities\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions (RSI(7) values: BTC 19.3, BNB 18.2, ETH 27.0), there could be bounce opportunities. However:\n1. MACD indicators are deeply negative across all assets\n2. All prices are significantly below EMA20\n3. The selloff appears to be accelerating (latest candles show continued weakness)\n4. We have limited capital ($9144 available)\n5. Both current positions are at risk in this environment\n\n**Conclusion**: This is NOT the time to add new positions. The market is in freefall and we should preserve capital. Better to wait for signs of stabilization (MACD turning positive, price reclaiming EMA20, RSI divergences).\n\n## Risk Management Decision\nWith only $9964 account value and both positions showing stress in a rapidly declining market, the prudent decision is to **CLOSE BOTH POSITIONS**:\n- BTC: Barely profitable, extreme bearish momentum\n- SOL: Take the $93 profit before it evaporates\n\nThis preserves capital and allows us to re-enter with better risk/reward when market stabilizes.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.06,\n      \"profit_target\": 109500.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 103000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 103,000\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 466.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - extreme bearish momentum with MACD at -1264 and market in freefall.

Let me analyze the market conditions for potential entry opportunities:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $106,821 vs EMA20: $109,341 (below EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 39.6 (oversold territory, approaching bounce zone)\n- RSI(14): 35.3 (oversold)\n- MACD: -1257.7 (deeply negative, but showing potential bottoming)\n- Price action: Severe drop from $111,288 to $105,589 (flash crash), now recovering to $106,821\n- The market experienced a violent selloff but is showing signs of stabilization\n- Below both 20 and 50 EMA on 4H timeframe - bearish structure\n- High volume (10,268 vs avg 8,437) suggests capitulation\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,797 vs EMA20: $3,928 (below EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 33.9 (oversold)\n- RSI(14): 33.7 (oversold)\n- MACD: -49.6 (negative and worsening)\n- Similar pattern to BTC - sharp drop from $4,061 to $3,756, now at $3,797\n- High volume (192k vs avg 150k) - capitulation signal\n- Below both EMAs - bearish\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $182.74 vs EMA20: $189.96 (below EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 41.6 (neutral-oversold)\n- RSI(14): 37.0 (oversold)\n- MACD: -3.88 (negative)\n- Drop from $196.80 to $177.65, recovering to $182.74\n- High volume (2.1M vs avg 1.3M) - strong selling pressure\n- Relative strength better than BTC/ETH\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,074 vs EMA20: $1,142 (significantly below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 20.8 (extremely oversold)\n- RSI(14): 22.7 (extremely oversold)\n- MACD: -22.7 (deeply negative)\n- Massive drop from $1,183 to $1,062 (~10% crash)\n- Most oversold of all assets - potential bounce candidate\n- Lower volume than average (13k vs 17k) - less conviction in selling\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.30 vs EMA20: $2.38 (below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 42.8 (neutral-oversold)\n- RSI(14): 38.0 (oversold)\n- MACD: -0.044 (negative but shallow)\n- Drop from $2.45 to $2.24, recovering to $2.30\n- Showing relative strength vs other assets\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.18475 vs EMA20: $0.19236 (below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 42.5 (neutral-oversold)\n- RSI(14): 37.3 (oversold)\n- MACD: -0.004 (negative)\n- Similar pattern - drop and partial recovery\n- High volume (77M vs avg 72M)\n\n## Trading Decision Rationale\n\n**Market Context:** All assets experienced a synchronized flash crash followed by partial recovery. This suggests a market-wide liquidation event rather than asset-specific weakness. RSI levels across all assets are in oversold territory, suggesting potential for mean reversion bounces.\n\n**Best Opportunity - BNB:**\n- Most oversold (RSI 20.8) with extreme dislocation from EMA\n- 10% drop presents significant bounce potential\n- Lower volume on the decline suggests exhaustion of sellers\n- Risk/reward favorable for counter-trend scalp\n\n**Secondary Opportunity - BTC:**\n- Largest market, most liquid\n- RSI approaching 40 after touching extreme lows\n- Stabilization pattern forming after capitulation\n- If BTC bounces, it will lead the market\n\nI will enter ONE position in BNB as it shows the most extreme oversold condition with highest probability of mean reversion bounce. I'll use tight risk management given the volatile conditions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 8,\n      \"profit_target\": 1110.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1055.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,055 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 15\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 228.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Account is down -1.23% from starting capital.\n\nLet me analyze the market conditions for potential entry opportunities:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $106,396 vs EMA20: $108,966 (below EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 35.05 (oversold territory, possible bounce)\n- RSI(14): 32.18 (oversold)\n- MACD: -1,589 (strongly negative, downtrend)\n- Price dropped from $111,405 to $106,396 (-4.5% in 30 minutes)\n- Below both 20 and 50 EMA on 4H timeframe\n- Assessment: Strong downtrend but approaching oversold levels. High risk to enter now.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,830.70 vs EMA20: $3,926 (below EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 45.61 (neutral, recovering from oversold)\n- RSI(14): 38.48 (approaching oversold)\n- MACD: -73.77 (negative but stabilizing)\n- Price dropped from $4,061 to $3,830 (-5.7% decline)\n- Showing slight recovery signs but still in downtrend\n- Assessment: Weak momentum, not ideal for entry yet.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $181.89 vs EMA20: $188.83 (below EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 38.26 (oversold territory)\n- RSI(14): 34.58 (oversold)\n- MACD: -4.57 (negative)\n- Price dropped from $196.80 to $181.89 (-7.6% decline)\n- Assessment: Deep oversold but no reversal signals yet.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,070.60 vs EMA20: $1,133.20 (significantly below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 25.06 (extremely oversold)\n- RSI(14): 22.80 (extremely oversold)\n- MACD: -33.56 (strongly negative)\n- Price crashed from $1,180.90 to $1,070.60 (-9.3% decline)\n- Assessment: Most oversold but dangerous - could continue dropping.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.29 vs EMA20: $2.37 (below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 39.82 (oversold)\n- RSI(14): 36.04 (oversold)\n- MACD: -0.050 (negative)\n- Price dropped from $2.45 to $2.29 (-6.5%)\n- Assessment: Oversold but weak momentum.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.18472 vs EMA20: $0.19141 (below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 43.47 (neutral, recovering)\n- RSI(14): 37.23 (approaching oversold)\n- MACD: -0.005 (negative but shallow)\n- Price dropped from $0.20026 to $0.18472 (-7.8%)\n- Assessment: Showing slight recovery, RSI improving.\n\n## Trading Decision\n\n**Market Context:** All coins are in clear downtrends with prices below their EMAs. While RSI levels show oversold conditions (potential bounce opportunity), the MACD indicators remain strongly negative across all assets, indicating continued bearish momentum. Volume is below average for most coins, suggesting weak conviction.\n\n**Risk Assessment:** Given that:\n1. This is only 2 minutes into trading (6th invocation)\n2. Account is already down -1.23%\n3. All major coins are in strong downtrends\n4. No clear reversal patterns yet\n5. MACD indicators still deeply negative\n\n**Decision:** WAIT for better entry opportunities. The market is showing capitulation but no confirmation of reversal. Entering now would be catching a falling knife. I'll wait for:\n- RSI to start diverging positively\n- MACD to show signs of turning\n- Price to reclaim EMA20 levels\n- Clear support level formation\n\nBetter to preserve capital and wait for confirmation than to force trades in unfavorable conditions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

I need to identify high-probability setups to recover losses while managing risk carefully.\n\n## Market Analysis by Coin:\n\n**BTC (107042):**\n- Price below EMA20 (108842.80), showing downtrend\n- RSI(7) at 49.9 - neutral zone, recovering from oversold\n- MACD at -1620, deeply negative but improving slightly (-1672 \u2192 -1620)\n- Recent price action: Sharp drop from 109160 to 105589, now recovering to 107042\n- Assessment: Trying to find a bottom but still in bearish structure. Price below both 20 and 50 EMA. Not a clear entry yet.\n\n**ETH (3869.70):**\n- Price below EMA20 (3923.90), bearish structure\n- RSI(7) at 59.8 - recovering nicely from oversold (20.2 \u2192 59.8)\n- MACD at -73.2, improving from -79.6\n- Recent bounce from 3756 to 3869, showing strength\n- Assessment: Strong recovery momentum, RSI showing bullish divergence. This is interesting but need confirmation.\n\n**SOL (184.74):**\n- Price below EMA20 (188.99), bearish\n- RSI(7) at 57.5 - good recovery from 15.7 oversold\n- MACD at -5.03, improving from -5.34\n- Recent bounce from 177.65 to 184.74\n- Assessment: Similar to ETH, showing recovery but still below key moving averages. Needs more confirmation.\n\n**BNB (1089.40):**\n- Price significantly below EMA20 (1129.28), strong downtrend\n- RSI(7) at 49.5 - neutral, recovering from extreme oversold (9.2)\n- MACD at -33.1, improving from -33.9\n- Recent sharp drop from 1149 to 1062, now at 1089\n- Assessment: Massive drop, trying to stabilize. Too risky given the volatility and distance from moving averages.\n\n**XRP (2.34):**\n- Price below EMA20 (2.37), slight bearish bias\n- RSI(7) at 62.3 - showing good momentum recovery\n- MACD at -0.050, improving from -0.054\n- Recent bounce from 2.24 to 2.34, tight consolidation\n- Assessment: Best technical setup. RSI showing strength, price near EMA20, MACD improving. Small spread suggests controlled movement.\n\n**DOGE (0.186810):**\n- Price below EMA20 (0.191154), bearish\n- RSI(7) at 55.9 - recovering momentum\n- MACD at -0.005, relatively stable\n- Recent bounce from 0.178490 to 0.186810\n- Assessment: Similar pattern to others but lower confidence due to meme coin volatility.\n\n## Trading Decision:\n\nGiven the market conditions, I see **XRP** as the best risk/reward setup:\n1. Cleanest technical recovery with RSI at 62.3 (bullish momentum)\n2. Price closest to EMA20 resistance (2.37) - easier breakout\n3. MACD showing clear improvement trend\n4. Tight price action suggests accumulation\n5. Lower volatility than BTC/ETH provides better risk control\n\nI'll enter a conservative position with:\n- Entry: 2.34\n- Stop-loss: 2.24 (below recent low, -4.3% from entry)\n- Profit target: 2.46 (above EMA20, +5.1% from entry)\n- Risk: $500 (5% of capital)\n- Leverage: 15x for position sizing efficiency\n- Invalidation: If price closes below 2.24 (recent support level)\n\nPosition size calculation: With 15x leverage and $500 risk, I can control ~$7,500 notional, which is approximately 3,205 XRP.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 3200,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.46,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.24,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.24 on 3-minute candle, breaking recent support\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The extreme overbought conditions (RSI 80.881), proximity to profit target (1.1% away), and deteriorating risk/reward ratio make this the prudent decision.

I need to evaluate whether to enter new positions.\n\n### BTC Analysis\n- Price: $111,161 (massive move from $107,062 to $111,161 in 30 minutes)\n- RSI(7): 91.2 - EXTREMELY overbought (danger zone above 90)\n- RSI(14): 82.3 - also very overbought\n- MACD: 341.85 - strong positive but coming from negative territory rapidly\n- Price above EMA20 ($108,296) by 2.6%\n- **Assessment**: Parabolic move, RSI at dangerous levels. High risk of pullback. AVOID entry at these levels.\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- Price: $4,053.40 (strong rally from $3,892 to $4,053)\n- RSI(7): 92.9 - EXTREMELY overbought (highest of all coins)\n- RSI(14): 83.9 - very overbought\n- MACD: 29.09 - strong bullish momentum\n- Price above EMA20 ($3,935) by 3%\n- **Assessment**: Even more overbought than BTC. Dangerous entry point. AVOID.\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- Price: $192.93 (moderate rally from $186.28)\n- RSI(7): 77.2 - overbought but not extreme\n- RSI(14): 70.8 - approaching overbought\n- MACD: 1.318 - positive and building\n- Price above EMA20 ($187.63) by 2.8%\n- **Assessment**: More reasonable RSI levels than BTC/ETH but still stretched. CAUTIOUS.\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- Price: $1,124.50 (recovery from $1,083.90)\n- RSI(7): 67.3 - elevated but not overbought\n- RSI(14): 61.0 - neutral to slightly bullish\n- MACD: -2.83 - still negative but improving\n- Price above EMA20 ($1,110.57) by 1.3%\n- **Assessment**: Most balanced setup. RSI in acceptable range, recovering from oversold. POTENTIAL ENTRY.\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- Price: $2.47 (strong move from $2.35)\n- RSI(7): 87.7 - very overbought\n- RSI(14): 78.3 - overbought\n- MACD: 0.022 - positive but small\n- Price above EMA20 ($2.38) by 3.8%\n- **Assessment**: Too overbought for entry. AVOID.\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- Price: $0.20115 (rally from $0.18927)\n- RSI(7): 86.1 - very overbought\n- RSI(14): 80.2 - overbought\n- MACD: 0.003 - positive momentum\n- Price above EMA20 ($0.192302) by 4.6%\n- **Assessment**: Overbought and extended.

This suggests the market is overheated and due for a pullback. However, BNB shows the most reasonable entry setup with RSI(7) at 67.3 and RSI(14) at 61.0.\n\n**Entry Strategy for BNB**:\n- Entry: $1,124.50\n- Stop-loss: $1,095 (2.6% below entry, below recent low of $1,083.90)\n- Profit target: $1,165 (3.6% gain, 1.4:1 reward/risk)\n- Invalidation: If RSI(14) drops below 50 or price closes below $1,100\n- Risk: ~$500 (5% of portfolio)\n- Leverage: 15x (moderate given better risk profile)\n\nThis is a tactical trade on the least overbought asset with a tight stop-loss to protect capital in case the broader market corrects.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.067,\n      \"profit_target\": 1165.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1095.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,100 on 3-minute candle or RSI(14) drops below 50\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Could be setting up for continuation.\n\n**SOL:**\n- Price: $188.77, weakening\n- RSI(7): 37.959 - oversold\n- MACD: 1.934 declining\n- Price barely above EMA20 ($187.94)\n- **Opportunity:** Weak momentum, not attractive.\n\n**XRP:**\n- Price: $2.52, strong surge\n- RSI(7): 89.376 - **EXTREMELY OVERBOUGHT**\n- RSI(14): 84.454 - very overbought\n- MACD: 0.044 strong and rising\n- Price well above EMA20 ($2.40)\n- Volume: 7.5M vs avg 4.7M - high participation\n- **Opportunity:** Parabolic move but dangerously overbought. High risk.\n\n**DOGE:**\n- Price: $0.19953, steady uptrend\n- RSI(7): 66.693 - approaching overbought\n- RSI(14): 72.685 - overbought but not extreme\n- MACD: 0.004 positive and rising\n- Price above EMA20 ($0.19370)\n- **Opportunity:** Strong trend with room to run before extreme levels.\n\n**Trading Decision:**\n1. Close BNB - invalidation condition met\n2. Enter DOGE - best risk/reward with strong momentum but not overextended\n3.

While the price hasn't hit the stop-loss at $0.1895, the technical setup that justified the entry is no longer valid. The RSI(7) at 33.772 shows strong selling pressure, and we're already down $77.74 on this position.\n\nRisk management dictates that when invalidation conditions are met, we should exit to preserve capital and avoid further losses. The position is still above stop-loss, so we can exit with a controlled small loss rather than waiting for potentially larger losses.\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- BTC: RSI(7) 26.889 - extremely oversold, but sharp drop from 109k area suggests continued weakness\n- ETH: RSI(7) 20.020 - extremely oversold, similar weakness\n- SOL: RSI(7) 24.147 - oversold\n- BNB: RSI(7) 16.018 - extremely oversold\n- XRP: RSI(7) 45.061 - neutral, showing relative strength\n\nAll major coins showing oversold conditions, but in a leveraged account with limited capital ($9,833.80 available), I need to be cautious about catching falling knives. The market appears to be in a correction phase across all assets.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nClose DOGE position due to invalidation condition being met (RSI(14) < 65). Do not enter new positions given the broad market weakness and need to preserve capital.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 25000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.2095,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.1895,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $0.189 on 3-minute candle or RSI(14) drops below 65\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation condition met - RSI(14) dropped to 51.902, below the 65 threshold specified in exit plan.

Potential bounce setup but risky.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,891.90 vs EMA20: $3,945.06 (below EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 14.59 - EXTREMELY oversold (critical level)\n- RSI(14): 30.72 - oversold\n- MACD: 19.76, declining from 40.07\n- Price action: Drop from $4,053 to $3,891 (4% decline)\n- Volume: 109,088 vs avg 71,049 - elevated volume\n- Assessment: Most oversold of all assets. High probability bounce candidate.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $184.93 vs EMA20: $187.86 (below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 22.17 - oversold\n- RSI(14): 34.60 - approaching oversold\n- MACD: 0.615, declining\n- Price action: Moderate decline from $192.93\n- Assessment: Oversold but less extreme than BTC/ETH\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,071.30 vs EMA20: $1,099.19 (significantly below)\n- RSI(7): 11.74 - MOST OVERSOLD of all assets\n- RSI(14): 26.74 - deeply oversold\n- MACD: -0.513 (negative and declining)\n- Price action: Sharp drop from $1,127.90 to $1,071.30 (5% decline)\n- Assessment: Extremely oversold, highest bounce potential but also most bearish momentum\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.43 vs EMA20: $2.42 (slightly above EMA - neutral)\n- RSI(7): 35.45 - neutral to slightly oversold\n- RSI(14): 47.79 - neutral\n- MACD: 0.032 (positive but declining)\n- Price action: Relatively stable, holding above EMA\n- Assessment: Most stable asset, less oversold than others\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.19416 vs EMA20: $0.19476 (slightly below)\n- RSI(7): 22.81 - oversold\n- RSI(14): 41.28 - neutral\n- MACD: 0.003 (stable)\n- Price action: Declining but not as severe\n- Assessment: Oversold but lower conviction\n\n## Trading Decision\n\nThe entire market is experiencing a sharp correction with most assets deeply oversold. This presents potential mean-reversion opportunities. However, the high volume on declines and negative MACD momentum suggest this could be the start of a larger correction rather than a simple pullback.\n\n**Best Entry Opportunity: ETH**\n- RSI(7) at 14.59 is the most extreme reading (critical oversold)\n- Price below EMA20 but not catastrophically so\n- Strong volume suggests capitulation may be near\n- Risk/reward favorable for a bounce trade\n\nI'll enter a LONG position on ETH with tight risk management, targeting a bounce back to the EMA20 level.\n\n**Risk Management:**\n- Using 15x leverage to keep position size moderate\n- Stop-loss below recent low with 2% buffer\n- Profit target at EMA20 resistance\n- Position size: ~$500 risk (5% of capital)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.9,\n      \"profit_target\": 3945.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3815.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,815 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 10\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

RSI(7) at 14.200 is critically low - just 4.2 points above the invalidation threshold of 10\n2. The recent candles show RSI(7) dropped from 38.834 to 19.749 to 14.495 to 14.200 - this is a severe downtrend\n3. Price has broken significantly below EMA20 and continues to weaken\n4. MACD momentum is collapsing (from 34.702 to 9.138)\n5. The invalidation condition states \"RSI(7) drops below 10\" - we're dangerously close at 14.200\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nWhile the invalidation condition hasn't been technically met yet (RSI is still above 10 and price above $3,815), the momentum is extremely bearish and RSI is in freefall. However, I must follow my trading rules strictly:\n- Invalidation condition NOT yet met (RSI still above 10, price above $3,815)\n- Stop-loss NOT hit ($3,890 > $3,815)\n- Profit target NOT hit ($3,890 < $3,945)\n\nGiven the extreme oversold RSI(7) at 14.200, there's potential for a bounce, but the risk is high.

If RSI drops below 10 on the next candle or price breaks $3,815, immediate exit is required.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC: RSI(7) 33.958 - oversold but recovering, no position\n- SOL: RSI(7) 37.101 - neutral, no position  \n- BNB: RSI(7) 23.919 - very oversold, no position\n- XRP: RSI(7) 38.327 - neutral, no position\n- DOGE: RSI(7) 26.377 - oversold, no position\n\nNo new positions warranted - all markets showing weakness and downward pressure.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.9,\n      \"profit_target\": 3945.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3815.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,815 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 10\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

This suggests a market-wide event (possibly news-driven). While momentum is strong, these are classic \"blow-off top\" characteristics:\n- Extreme RSI readings across all coins\n- Massive volume spikes\n- Parabolic price action\n- Simultaneous moves (correlation = 1.0)\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nGiven the parabolic nature and overbought conditions, the risk of immediate pullback is HIGH. However, strong momentum can continue in crypto markets. The key is tight risk management.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI will enter ONE position in the coin showing the best risk/reward setup:\n- **BTC** has the strongest momentum (MACD 844.89) and highest volume spike (4.3x)\n- However, it's also the most extended\n- **XRP** shows moderate RSI (72.69) with room to run, and strong volume\n- **BNB** is weakest - avoid\n\n**Selected Trade: XRP**\n- Reasons: (1) RSI 72.69 is overbought but not extreme like others, (2) Strong volume confirmation, (3) Price just broke above recent resistance, (4) MACD positive and building\n- Risk: Tight stop-loss below recent consolidation\n- Entry: Market buy at $2.52\n- Stop-loss: $2.40 (below recent consolidation and EMA20)\n- Profit target: $2.68 (6.3% gain, 2:1 R/R)\n- Position size: Risk $500 (4.8% of account)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2083,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.68,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.40,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.40 on 3-minute candle or if RSI(7) drops below 30 indicating momentum reversal\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Wait for confirmation.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,866.90 vs EMA20: $3,937.11 (below EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 35.33 (oversold)\n- RSI(14): 39.27 (bearish)\n- MACD: -6.97 (negative and declining)\n- Price dropped from $4,082.90 to current levels\n- Similar pattern to BTC - oversold but no reversal\n- Assessment: Oversold conditions but MACD turning negative is concerning. Wait.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $184.90 vs EMA20: $188.23 (below EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 34.24 (oversold)\n- RSI(14): 40.33 (bearish)\n- MACD: -0.14 (just turned negative)\n- Sharp rejection from $196.14\n- Assessment: Oversold but weak momentum.

The question is whether we're seeing capitulation (good entry) or the start of a deeper correction (wait).\n\n**Risk Management Consideration:** With $10,214.83 available and no positions, I can afford to take a calculated position. However, the lack of clear reversal signals (no bullish MACD crosses, no strong bounces off support) suggests caution.\n\n**Best Opportunity:** XRP shows the most promise:\n1. Least oversold relative to peers\n2. MACD still positive (0.015) while others are negative\n3. Price holding above key psychological level at $2.40\n4. RSI(7) at 32.39 suggests potential bounce imminent\n\n**Entry Strategy for XRP:**\n- Entry: $2.41 (current price)\n- Stop-loss: $2.35 (2.5% below, below recent low of $2.42 with buffer)\n- Profit target: $2.52 (4.6% gain, recent high resistance)\n- Risk: ~$300 (3% of portfolio)\n- Leverage: 15x (moderate given oversold conditions)\n- Invalidation: If price closes below $2.38 (breaks support structure)\n\nThis provides a favorable 1.8:1 risk-reward ratio with clear exit parameters.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1863,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.52,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.35,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.38 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown of support structure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 300\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

My account value is $10,190.04 with 1.90% total return and a strong Sharpe ratio of 3.065. Let me analyze the market conditions for potential entry opportunities.\n\n## Market Overview - All Coins Showing Weakness\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $107,840 vs EMA20: $109,037 (below EMA, bearish)\n- RSI(7): 38.4 (oversold territory but not extreme)\n- RSI(14): 41.6 (neutral-bearish)\n- MACD: -196.93 (strongly negative, downtrend)\n- Price action: Sharp rejection from $113,386 spike, now consolidating lower\n- Recent pattern: Failed rally attempt, selling pressure dominant\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,802 vs EMA20: $3,917 (3% below EMA, bearish)\n- RSI(7): 25.4 (oversold - potential bounce candidate)\n- RSI(14): 31.6 (oversold)\n- MACD: -39.07 (negative, downtrend)\n- Price action: Similar spike rejection from $4,082, now at session lows\n- Volume: 87,553 vs avg 104,639 (lower volume on decline)\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $180.17 vs EMA20: $187.33 (3.8% below EMA, most bearish)\n- RSI(7): 17.5 (EXTREMELY oversold - strongest bounce candidate)\n- RSI(14): 28.6 (oversold)\n- MACD: -1.80 (negative)\n- Price action: Rejected from $196.14, now at extreme lows\n- Volume: 1,092,516 vs avg 717,816 (52% above average - capitulation volume?)\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,068.90 vs EMA20: $1,088.30 (1.8% below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 41.5 (neutral, not oversold)\n- RSI(14): 40.7 (neutral)\n- MACD: -12.17 (negative but stabilizing)\n- Least oversold of major coins\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.38 vs EMA20: $2.43 (2% below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 22.8 (oversold)\n- RSI(14): 34.2 (approaching oversold)\n- MACD: -0.004 (barely negative, could reverse)\n- Volume: 11.68M vs avg 6.85M (70% above average)\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.1905 vs EMA20: $0.1953 (2.5% below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 28.4 (oversold)\n- RSI(14): 34.4 (approaching oversold)\n- MACD: -0.001 (negative)\n- Volume: 41.2M vs avg 30.1M (37% above average)\n\n## Trading Decision\n\n**SOL appears to be the best opportunity:**\n- RSI(7) at 17.5 is EXTREMELY oversold (most extreme reading across all coins)\n- Price 3.8% below EMA20 with heavy selling exhaustion\n- Volume 52% above average suggests capitulation\n- Risk/reward favorable for mean reversion trade\n- All altcoins showing similar patterns, but SOL most extreme\n\n**Entry Strategy for SOL:**\n- Entry: $180.17 (current price)\n- Stop-loss: $175.00 (2.9% below entry, below recent lows)\n- Profit target: $190.00 (5.5% gain, near EMA20 resistance)\n- Invalidation: If price closes below $175 or if RSI(7) fails to bounce above 30 within next 30 minutes\n- Leverage: 15x (moderate given oversold conditions)\n- Risk: ~$300 (3% of capital)\n- Position size: ~11 SOL ($1,981 notional / 15x leverage = $132 margin)\n\nThis is a tactical mean-reversion trade on extreme oversold conditions with tight risk management.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 11,\n      \"profit_target\": 190.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 175.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $175 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) fails to bounce above 30 within 30 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 300\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

We're now at least 9-12 minutes into this condition (3 candles at 3-minute intervals), and RSI has WORSENED from 29.636 to 17.066. This is not a bounce - this is continued deterioration. The momentum is clearly broken.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- While price hasn't hit stop-loss at $175, the technical structure is severely damaged\n- RSI at 17.066 is extreme, but in a downtrend this can persist\n- The failure to bounce above 30 suggests continued selling pressure\n- Risk of further decline toward stop-loss is elevated\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION**\nThe invalidation condition is effectively met. RSI(7) has not bounced above 30 and instead has collapsed to 17.066, showing continued weakness. While we could wait the full 30 minutes, the severity of the RSI decline (from 29.636 to 17.066) and negative MACD momentum suggest the bounce scenario has failed. Prudent risk management dictates exiting before reaching the hard stop-loss at $175.\n\n**Other Coins Assessment:**\n- BTC, ETH, XRP, DOGE: All showing oversold RSI readings (BTC: 34.6, ETH: 26.2, XRP: 18.9, DOGE: 25.3)\n- All below their EMA20s with negative MACD\n- BNB: RSI 44.5 (less oversold but still weak)\n- Market-wide weakness suggests this is a broader correction\n- No attractive entry setups - all coins in downtrends with no reversal signals\n- Will preserve capital and wait for better opportunities\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 11.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 190.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 175.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $175 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) fails to bounce above 30 within 30 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 300.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation condition met - RSI(7) failed to bounce above 30 and instead collapsed from 29.636 to 17.066 over 3 candles, indicating continued selling pressure and broken momentum structure\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, RSI at 80.6 is in extreme overbought territory, which typically signals an imminent pullback. The invalidation condition has NOT been met (price hasn't closed below $178.50).\n\nGiven that:\n1. We're within 0.5% of profit target\n2. RSI is dangerously overbought (>80)\n3. We have solid unrealized gains (+4.5%)\n4. Risk/reward favors taking profits now rather than risking a sharp reversal\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION** - Taking profits at current levels. While the invalidation hasn't technically been met, we're at extreme overbought levels and within striking distance of our target. This is prudent risk management.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** Price $109,910, RSI 73.5 (overbought), MACD improving but still negative. Strong recent rally but no position to manage.\n\n**ETH:** Price $3,877, RSI 61.5 (neutral), below EMA20. Consolidating but no clear setup.\n\n**BNB:** Price $1,130, RSI 77.7 (overbought), strong rally from $1,067. Momentum strong but late to enter.\n\n**XRP:** Price $2.41, RSI 58.1 (neutral), range-bound. No compelling setup.\n\n**DOGE:** Price $0.1954, RSI 70.7 (overbought), above EMA20. Similar to SOL - strong but extended.\n\n**Conclusion:** Not entering new positions. Market showing overbought conditions across multiple coins. Better to lock in SOL profits and wait for better entry opportunities.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 3.2,\n      \"profit_target\": 192.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 178.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $178.50 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 495.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Taking profits - RSI at extreme overbought level (80.6) with price within 0.5% of profit target ($192).

Price made new high at 191.27, but RSI slightly lower. This is a **subtle bearish divergence forming**\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- RSI(7) at 80+ is dangerously overbought - historically precedes pullbacks\n- The bearish divergence (price new high, RSI lower high) is a classic reversal signal\n- Below-average volume suggests weak buying pressure at these levels\n- With 15x leverage, even a small 3-4% pullback could trigger stop-loss\n- Position is essentially breakeven, making this a good risk-free exit opportunity\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION**\nThe invalidation condition mentions \"RSI(7) forms bearish divergence\" - this is occurring now. Price made a new high at 191.27 while RSI dropped from 81.489 to 80.326. Combined with extreme overbought conditions and weak volume, the risk/reward no longer favors holding.

This is typically followed by corrections or consolidation. Volume is concerningly low across most assets (only ETH has above-average volume).\n\n**Best Opportunity:**\nBNB stands out with RSI(7) at 59.64 - the only coin NOT overbought. It has room to run and is showing strong momentum with positive MACD. However, volume is still weak at 52% below average.\n\n**Strategy:**\nGiven the extreme overbought conditions across most of the market and weak volume, I will take a CONSERVATIVE approach and enter ONE position in BNB, which has the best technical setup. I'll use moderate leverage (15x) and tight risk management given the overall market exhaustion signals.\n\nRisk per trade: ~$500 (5% of capital)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.067,\n      \"profit_target\": 1165.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1095.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,095 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) exceeds 85 indicating overextension\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price below $1,095? NO - current $1,103.40 is $8.40 above stop\n2. RSI(7) exceeds 85? NO - current RSI(7) is 34.252\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe position has NOT met its invalidation conditions. While there's been a sharp pullback and the position is slightly underwater, the technical setup hasn't broken down:\n- Stop-loss hasn't been hit\n- RSI shows oversold conditions (34), not overbought\n- MACD still positive\n- Price remains above the stop-loss level\n\nHowever, this is concerning: The sharp drop from $1,124.80 to $1,103.40 and the RSI dropping to 34 suggests selling pressure. The position is getting close to the stop-loss ($8.40 buffer). Given the momentum shift and proximity to stop-loss, I should continue holding but monitor closely.\n\n**Other Coins - Potential New Positions:**\n\n**XRP:** \n- Strong momentum: RSI(7) at 87.315 (extremely overbought)\n- Price: $2.48, well above EMA20: $2.42\n- MACD just turned positive (0.003)\n- Volume spike: 10.7M vs avg 6.6M\n- This is TOO overbought to enter - high risk of reversal\n\n**BTC:**\n- Current: $110,109, dropped sharply from $111,100\n- RSI(7): 44.879 - dropped from 85 (major reversal signal)\n- MACD: 487.189 declining from 507.593\n- Price above EMA20 but losing momentum\n- Not a good entry after such a sharp drop\n\n**SOL:**\n- Sharp drop from $192.03 to $189.29\n- RSI(7): 38.006 - oversold\n- MACD: 1.276 positive but declining\n- Similar pattern to BNB - selling pressure\n\n**ETH:**\n- Price: $3,890, near EMA20: $3,885.37\n- RSI(7): 45.165 - neutral\n- Sharp drop from $3,947.70\n- Weak setup after pullback\n\n**DOGE:**\n- RSI(7): 43.865 - neutral\n- Price near EMA20\n- No strong directional bias\n\n**Conclusion:** Hold BNB position as invalidation conditions are not met. No new entries - market showing pullback/consolidation across all assets after recent strength.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.067,\n      \"profit_target\": 1165.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1095.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,095 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) exceeds 85 indicating overextension\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price check: $1,112.20 is ABOVE $1,095 \u2713\n2. RSI(7) check: Current RSI(7) = 48.077, well BELOW 85 \u2713\n3. Recent price action: Dropped from $1,134.90 to $1,112.20, showing weakness\n4. Technical indicators:\n   - RSI(7): 48.077 - neutral, showing recent weakness\n   - RSI(14): 53.516 - neutral\n   - MACD: 11.244 - positive but declining from 15.913\n   - Price below recent highs, consolidating\n\n**Decision on BNB:** The invalidation conditions are NOT met. Price is above stop-loss and RSI is not overbought. However, the position is showing weakness with declining momentum (MACD falling, RSI dropping from 75+ to 48). Given the small loss and weakening technicals, I'll HOLD but monitor closely. The position still has room to recover to profit target.\n\n## New Opportunity Analysis\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.54, showing explosive momentum\n- RSI(7): 95.627 - EXTREMELY overbought (danger zone)\n- RSI(14): 87.724 - also extremely overbought\n- MACD: 0.029 - strongly positive and accelerating\n- Price action: Massive rally from $2.39 to $2.54 (+6.3% in 30 minutes)\n- Above EMA20 ($2.45) with strong uptrend\n\n**Decision on XRP:** Despite the strong momentum, RSI(7) at 95.627 is dangerously overbought. This level typically precedes sharp corrections. The risk/reward is unfavorable for entry at these extreme levels. **PASS** - too risky to chase.\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $111,551, strong uptrend\n- RSI(7): 77.864 - overbought but not extreme\n- RSI(14): 73.530 - moderately overbought\n- MACD: 783.443 - very strong and rising\n- Price well above EMA20 ($109,957.68)\n\n**Decision on BTC:** Overbought but not at extreme levels like XRP. However, with limited capital ($10,208) and one position already open, I'll be selective. **PASS** - preserve capital.\n\n**Other coins (ETH, SOL, DOGE):** All showing moderate strength but no compelling setups that justify new positions with limited capital. Will monitor.\n\n## Risk Management Summary\n- Current exposure: $74.52 in BNB (0.73% of account)\n- Available cash: $10,208.94\n- Portfolio performing well: +2.13% return, Sharpe 3.128\n- Strategy: Hold BNB position as invalidation not met, avoid chasing overextended moves\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.067,\n      \"profit_target\": 1165.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1095.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,095 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) exceeds 85 indicating overextension\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Momentum cooling after recent rally.\n\n**XRP:** RSI(7) at 97.1 (EXTREMELY overbought), RSI(14) at 90.4. Parabolic move from $2.39 to $2.56. This is a dangerous entry point - severely overextended.\n\n**DOGE:** RSI(7) at 61.1, above EMA20, positive MACD. Consolidating after recent move. Not compelling enough.\n\n**Risk Management:** With only one small position ($74.71 notional) and $10,208.94 available cash, I have room for additional positions, but current market conditions show most coins either overextended (BTC, XRP) or lacking strong setups.

However, the technical picture is deteriorating:\n1. RSI(7) collapsed from 75+ to 38.957 - sharp bearish reversal\n2. MACD declining steadily from 15.5 to 9.5\n3.

The RSI drop from overbought to near oversold in such short time suggests strong selling pressure. While the invalidation isn't technically met, the momentum has clearly shifted bearish.\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION** - The rapid RSI deterioration and MACD decline indicate the bullish setup has failed.

Low volume on rally is concerning.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Price: $3,957.60 (above EMA20: $3,903)\n- RSI(7): 72.27 - similar overbought territory as BTC\n- MACD: 26.81 - positive and rising\n- Recent action: Strong recovery from $3,890, making new highs\n- Volume: Very low (28,812 vs 74,942) - major red flag\n- Trend: Clean uptrend, price consistently above EMAs\n- Concern: Low volume rally lacks sustainability\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Price: $194.42 (above EMA20: $190.42)\n- RSI(7): 68.51 - approaching overbought\n- MACD: 2.34 - positive momentum\n- Recent action: Volatile, dipped to $189.29, recovered strongly\n- Volume: Low (218,770 vs 601,978)\n- Trend: Bullish but choppy price action\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Price: $2.60 (significantly above EMA20: $2.49)\n- RSI(7): 98.46 - EXTREMELY overbought (danger zone!)\n- RSI(14): 93.73 - also extremely overbought\n- MACD: 0.048 - rising but RSI at unsustainable levels\n- Recent action: Parabolic move from $2.44 to $2.60 in 30 minutes\n- Volume: Above average (7.7M vs 5.6M) - strong participation\n- Assessment: This is a blow-off top pattern. RSI at 98+ is rarely sustainable.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Price: $1,115.70 (above EMA20: $1,107.54)\n- RSI(7): 56.61 - neutral, healthy zone\n- MACD: 7.15 - positive but declining\n- Recent action: Choppy consolidation, no clear direction\n- Volume: Very low (2,723 vs 8,968)\n- Assessment: Weak setup, no compelling signal\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Price: $0.19726 (above EMA20: $0.19552)\n- RSI(7): 56.38 - neutral\n- MACD: 0.001 - minimal momentum\n- Recent action: Choppy, no clear trend\n- Volume: Low (7.9M vs 20M)\n- Assessment: Weak setup, sideways action\n\n## Trading Decision Rationale\n\nGiven the market conditions:\n1. **Most coins showing low volume** - raises sustainability concerns\n2. **XRP showing extreme overbought conditions** - RSI 98.46 is a contrarian signal\n3. **BTC and ETH** - while bullish, the low volume is concerning for new longs\n\n**XRP Short Opportunity:**\n- RSI(7) at 98.46 and RSI(14) at 93.73 are extreme levels\n- Price extended 11% above EMA20 in rapid move\n- Volume spike confirms exhaustion buying\n- High probability of mean reversion\n- Risk: Could spike higher before reversal, but odds favor pullback\n\nStrategy: Take a SHORT position on XRP targeting mean reversion to EMA20 area ($2.49). Use tight stop-loss above recent high. This is a counter-trend scalp trade based on extreme overbought conditions.\n\nRisk management: $500 risk (~5% of capital), 15x leverage for precision entry.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1923,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.49,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.65,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes above $2.65 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued parabolic move\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, the RSI readings are concerning:\n- 7-period RSI at 85.8 indicates extreme overbought conditions\n- 14-period RSI at 88.8 is in the danger zone for sharp reversals\n- Previous readings showed RSI peaked above 98, now cooling to 85-86\n- This suggests momentum exhaustion and increased reversal risk\n\n**Risk Management Consideration:**\nWhile the invalidation condition is not met, the extreme overbought conditions present significant reversal risk. The position is only up 0.23% ($11), and with 15x leverage, a small reversal could quickly turn this into a loss. The RSI pattern shows cooling from extreme levels (98+ down to 85), which often precedes corrections.\n\n**Decision:** CLOSE POSITION\nReason: Risk management - extreme overbought conditions (RSI 85.8) with signs of momentum exhaustion. While invalidation not technically met, the risk/reward at these levels is unfavorable with minimal profit locked in and high reversal probability. Better to take the small profit and avoid potential whipsaw.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC: RSI 44.9 (neutral), price consolidating. No clear setup.\n- ETH: RSI 44.0 (neutral), similar consolidation. No edge.\n- SOL: RSI 48.3 (neutral), choppy price action. Pass.\n- BNB: RSI 58.9 (neutral-bullish), but limited conviction. Pass.\n- DOGE: RSI 27.8 (oversold), but below EMA20 and weak momentum. Pass.\n\nNo new positions warranted given current market conditions and lack of clear setups.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 2400.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.75,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.51,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.50 on 3-minute candle, indicating momentum break and loss of support\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - extreme overbought conditions with RSI at 85.8 showing momentum exhaustion after peaking above 98.

However, RSI is dangerously overbought at 86.7, suggesting imminent pullback risk. Price is very close to profit target ($1,191 away). Given the extreme overbought conditions and proximity to target, I should consider taking profits rather than risking a reversal.\n- **Decision: CLOSE_POSITION** - Taking profits at current levels due to extreme overbought RSI and proximity to profit target. Better to lock in gains than risk reversal.\n\n**ETH Position Analysis:**\n- Entry: $3,951.50 | Current: $4,045.20 | Unrealized P&L: +$128.41 (+2.37%)\n- Profit target: $4,050 (only $4.80 away - 0.12%)\n- Stop-loss: $3,890\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below EMA20 ($3,913) on 3-minute candle with RSI dropping below 50\"\n- Current EMA20: $3,933.26 (price well above)\n- Current RSI (7-period): 85.973 (extremely overbought)\n- Current MACD: 25.097 (positive and rising)\n- Analysis: Invalidation NOT met - price above EMA20 and RSI well above 50. However, profit target is essentially hit (only $4.80 away). RSI at 85.973 shows extreme overbought conditions similar to BTC. This is an excellent exit point.\n- **Decision: CLOSE_POSITION** - Profit target essentially reached, extreme overbought RSI signals reversal risk. Lock in profits.\n\n**BNB Position Analysis:**\n- Entry: $1,120.00 | Current: $1,135.10 | Unrealized P&L: +$6.54 (+1.35%)\n- Profit target: $1,145 ($9.90 away - 0.87%)\n- Stop-loss: $1,100\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below EMA20 ($1,111) on 3-minute candle or RSI drops below 45\"\n- Current EMA20: $1,116.54 (price above)\n- Current RSI (7-period): 86.271 (extremely overbought)\n- Current RSI (14-period): 71.257 (overbought)\n- Current MACD: 2.783 (positive and rising)\n- Analysis: Invalidation NOT met - price above EMA20 and RSI well above 45. However, RSI at 86.271 is extremely overbought, matching the pattern across all positions. Price is approaching profit target. Given the coordinated overbought conditions across the entire portfolio, this signals a market-wide reversal risk.\n- **Decision: CLOSE_POSITION** - Extreme overbought RSI (86.271) and coordinated market exhaustion signals across all positions. Taking profits to protect capital.\n\n**Market Context:**\nAll three positions show extreme overbought RSI readings (BTC: 86.8, ETH: 86.0, BNB: 86.3), which is highly unusual and indicates market exhaustion. This coordinated overbought condition across major coins suggests an imminent pullback. With all positions profitable and near targets, the prudent risk management decision is to close all positions and preserve gains.\n\n**Other Coins (SOL, XRP, DOGE):**\n- SOL: RSI 81.663 (overbought), no position\n- XRP: RSI 94.001 (dangerously overbought), no position  \n- DOGE: RSI 80.480 (overbought), no position\n- Analysis: All showing extreme overbought conditions.

Position is only marginally profitable (+0.46%)\n\nThe invalidation condition is NOT triggered, so the position remains valid. The price is holding above the EMA20 and maintaining the $2.60+ level.

Price check: Current $2.63 is ABOVE $2.50 stop-loss \u2713\n2. RSI(7) check: Current 43.905 is ABOVE 35 threshold \u2713\n3. Recent price action: Last 10 candles show [$2.65, $2.64, $2.61, $2.65, $2.63, $2.63, $2.63, $2.66, $2.67, $2.63]\n4.

It dropped from 77 to 43.9 in just one candle - a massive momentum shift. While technically above 35, this is a warning sign. The position is barely profitable (+0.74%) and showing clear momentum exhaustion after the recent rally.\n\n**Decision:** HOLD for now, but this position is on thin ice. The invalidation condition has NOT been met yet (RSI still above 35, price above $2.50), but we're getting close. The sharp RSI drop is concerning, but I should respect my exit plan and only close if the actual invalidation triggers.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC: Strong rally followed by sharp pullback (114111 from 115566 high). RSI(7) at 34.819 is very oversold - potential bounce setup, but also risky after such a strong move up\n- ETH: Similar pattern, RSI(7) at 39.129, pulling back from highs\n- SOL: RSI(7) at 36.495, consolidating near EMA20\n- BNB: RSI(7) at 40.852, pullback after spike to $1180\n- DOGE: RSI(7) at 27.307 - extremely oversold, but momentum clearly broken\n\nGiven the sharp pullbacks across all assets and my existing XRP position at risk, I will NOT open any new positions.

      "raw_response": "# CHAIN OF THOUGHT\n\n**Current Market Analysis:**\n\nAll major coins are showing severe oversold conditions with extremely low RSI readings and declining prices below their EMAs. This represents a potential capitulation event or sharp correction:\n\n- **BTC**: Price 112,864 (below EMA20 113,692), RSI-7: 19.5 (extremely oversold), MACD declining rapidly from 935 to 452\n- **ETH**: Price 3,978 (below EMA20 4,072), RSI-7: 11.6 (severely oversold), MACD declining from 61 to 18\n- **SOL**: Price 194.24 (below EMA20 198.06), RSI-7: 17.7 (extremely oversold), MACD declining from 1.8 to 0.5\n- **BNB**: Price 1,102.30 (below EMA20 1,131), RSI-7: 12.4 (severely oversold), MACD declining from 10.8 to 0.8\n- **XRP**: Price 2.60 (below EMA20 2.63), RSI-7: 21.0 (oversold), MACD declining\n- **DOGE**: Price 0.1936 (below EMA20 0.1996), RSI-7: 7.3 (catastrophically oversold), MACD negative\n\n**Current Portfolio Status:**\n- No open positions\n- Available cash: $10,277.07\n- Total return: +2.77%\n- Sharpe ratio: 3.076\n\n**Trading Decision Rationale:**\n\nThis is a classic oversold bounce opportunity. When RSI-7 drops below 20 (especially below 15), it often signals panic selling and presents high-probability mean reversion setups. The key is to:\n\n1. Enter positions with tight stop-losses below recent lows\n2. Target quick bounces back toward EMA20 levels\n3. Use moderate leverage (10-15x) given the volatility\n4. Focus on coins with the most extreme oversold readings\n\n**Selected Trades:**\n\n**DOGE** - RSI-7 at 7.3 is catastrophically oversold. This is the most extreme reading across all coins. High probability of bounce.\n- Entry: 0.1936\n- Target: 0.1996 (EMA20, +3.1% move)\n- Stop: 0.1900 (-1.9%)\n- Risk: $300\n\n**ETH** - RSI-7 at 11.6 is severely oversold, second-worst reading. Strong bounce candidate.\n- Entry: 3,978\n- Target: 4,072 (EMA20, +2.4% move)\n- Stop: 3,920 (-1.5%)\n- Risk: $300\n\n**BNB** - RSI-7 at 12.4, also severely oversold with clear support near 1,100.\n- Entry: 1,102.30\n- Target: 1,131 (EMA20, +2.6% move)\n- Stop: 1,080 (-2.0%)\n- Risk: $300\n\n**SOL** - RSI-7 at 17.7, oversold but not as extreme. Still a good bounce setup.\n- Entry: 194.24\n- Target: 198.06 (EMA20, +2.0% move)\n- Stop: 190.00 (-2.2%)\n- Risk: $300\n\nTotal risk allocation: $1,200 (~11.7% of account)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 15500,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.1996,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.1900,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.1900 on 3-minute candle, indicating further capitulation\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.82,\n      \"risk_usd\": 300\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.2,\n      \"profit_target\": 4072.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3920.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3920 on 3-minute candle, breaking recent support\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 300\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.85,\n      \"profit_target\": 1131.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1080.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1080 on 3-minute candle, confirming breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 300\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 78,\n      \"profit_target\": 198.06,\n      \"stop_loss\": 190.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 190.0 on 3-minute candle, extending the downtrend\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.73,\n      \"risk_usd\": 300\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The invalidation condition hasn't been met yet (not below 3920), but we're in severe oversold territory with accelerating bearish momentum. The position is at risk but the invalidation trigger hasn't occurred. Given the extreme oversold RSI (19.701), there's potential for a bounce, but the MACD deterioration is concerning.\n\n**Decision:** HOLD - Invalidation condition not yet met. Price is above 3920. Will monitor closely but the extreme oversold condition suggests possible reversal. Stop-loss will protect if it breaks down further.\n\n## BNB Position Analysis\n- **Entry:** 1102.3, **Current:** 1098.9 (down $3.40 per unit)\n- **Unrealized P&L:** -$7.31 (-0.36%)\n- **Stop-loss:** 1080.0, **Profit target:** 1131.0\n- **Invalidation condition:** \"If price closes below 1080 on 3-minute candle, confirming breakdown\"\n- **Current technical state:**\n  - RSI (7-period): 24.728 - oversold\n  - RSI (14-period): 29.675 - oversold\n  - MACD: -8.050 - bearish and accelerating down\n  - Price below EMA20 (1125.90) by $27.00\n  - Recent price action: 1116.60 \u2192 1113.00 \u2192 1098.90 (downtrend)\n\n**Critical assessment:** Price at 1098.90 is $18.90 above stop-loss at 1080.0. Invalidation condition not met. Position showing similar pattern to ETH - oversold but with bearish momentum. The buffer to stop-loss is reasonable (~1.7%). RSI oversold could signal bounce potential.\n\n**Decision:** HOLD - Invalidation condition not met. Price remains above 1080. Oversold RSI suggests potential for relief bounce.\n\n## Market Context for Non-Positions\n\n**BTC:** RSI 21.452 (severely oversold), MACD -273.783 (extreme bearish), price 111510 well below EMA20 113567.60. Massive selloff in progress. Too risky to enter during this capitulation phase.\n\n**SOL:** RSI 47.842 (neutral), MACD -0.599 (slightly bearish), price 196.76 slightly below EMA20 198.02. Most stable of all coins but showing weakness. No compelling entry.\n\n**XRP:** RSI 45.002 (neutral), MACD -0.004 (neutral), price 2.62 near EMA20 2.63. Consolidating but no clear direction. No setup.\n\n**DOGE:** RSI 20.293 (severely oversold), MACD -0.002 (bearish), price 0.190980 well below EMA20 0.198149. In freefall like BTC/ETH. Avoid.\n\n**Overall market assessment:** Broad-based selloff across major coins (BTC, ETH, DOGE down hard). My two positions are in oversold territory but haven't hit invalidation levels. Market appears to be in capitulation phase - not the time to add new positions. Will hold existing positions as invalidation conditions not met, allowing stop-losses to protect capital if breakdown continues.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.2,\n      \"profit_target\": 4072.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3920.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3920 on 3-minute candle, breaking recent support\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 300.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.85,\n      \"profit_target\": 1131.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1080.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1080 on 3-minute candle, confirming breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 300.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

MACD deeply negative at -542.516. Price well below EMA20 (113,349). This is capitulation territory.\n\n**ETH**: Similar severe decline - price at 3,903.30 down from 4,116.30. RSI(7) at 13.637 (extreme oversold). MACD at -37.182. Price significantly below EMA20 (4,047.32). High volume (3x average) suggests panic selling.\n\n**SOL**: Price at 192.75 down from 202.32. RSI(7) at 28.319 (oversold but not extreme). MACD slightly negative at -1.235. Below EMA20 (197.74). High volume (3.7x average).\n\n**BNB**: Price at 1,106.70, showing some recovery. RSI(7) at 40.811 (neutral zone). MACD at -8.239. Below EMA20 (1,123.85). This is my current position.\n\n**XRP**: Price at 2.59 down from 2.64. RSI(7) at 26.018 (oversold). MACD slightly negative. High volume (4.3x average).\n\n**DOGE**: Price at 0.193870, showing recovery. RSI(7) at 45.285 (neutral). MACD at -0.003.

Price remains above 1,080.00 stop-loss level. While the broader market is in severe decline, BNB is showing relative strength and recovery. The position has defined risk management in place.\n\n## New Trade Opportunities\n\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions across the board (BTC RSI 16.118, ETH RSI 13.637), these are potential reversal setups. However:\n\n1. **Risk Management**: Already have 1 position using ~$2,047 notional (~20% of capital with 15x leverage)\n2. **Market Conditions**: Extreme volatility and panic selling - could continue lower\n3. **Cash Preservation**: Have $10,042 available but should maintain prudent exposure\n4. **Timing**: These extreme RSI readings often lead to bounces, but catching exact bottoms is risky\n\n**Decision on New Trades**: Will NOT enter new positions. The market is in extreme distress with potential for further downside despite oversold readings. Better to preserve capital and manage existing position.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.85,\n      \"profit_target\": 1131.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1080.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1080 on 3-minute candle, confirming breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 300.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

MACD deeply negative (-711.987). Too risky to enter during such a sharp decline.\n- **ETH**: RSI 13.487 - severely oversold, dropped from 4111.80 to 3902.00 (-5.1%). MACD negative. Similar to BTC, too volatile to enter now.\n- **SOL**: RSI 38.638 - showing some recovery. Price stabilizing around 194. More attractive than BTC/ETH but still in downtrend.\n- **XRP**: RSI 16.840 - oversold, dropped from 2.64 to 2.55. Sharp decline, avoid.\n- **DOGE**: RSI 36.784 - weak, below EMA20. No clear setup.\n\nGiven the broad market weakness (BTC and ETH both showing severe oversold conditions with sharp drops), I will maintain my BNB position as it's the most stable and above its invalidation level, but will not add new positions in this volatile environment.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.85,\n      \"profit_target\": 1131.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1080.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1080 on 3-minute candle, confirming breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 300.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price is well above the stop-loss at 1080.0 and the invalidation condition has NOT been met. The recent price action shows a strong bounce from 1098.90 to 1118.30, with RSI(7) at 62 indicating bullish momentum without being overbought. \n\nHowever, the profit target at 1131.0 is only 12.7 points away (1.1%), and we're already up 1.45%. The low volume is concerning as it suggests this move may not be sustainable. MACD remains negative despite improvement.\n\nGiven we're close to the profit target and showing good momentum, I'll HOLD to capture the remaining upside to 1131.0. The invalidation condition is clear and not triggered (price would need to close below 1080, currently at 1118.3).\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC: Oversold (RSI 33.78) but in strong downtrend, below EMA20 by 2115 points. Too risky.\n- ETH: Oversold (RSI 36.35) but below EMA20, negative MACD. Not attractive.\n- SOL: Near EMA20, RSI 58.85 showing recovery. Interesting but no clear setup.\n- XRP: Below EMA20, weak momentum. Pass.\n- DOGE: Below EMA20, weak overall. Pass.\n\nNo new positions warranted given current market weakness across major coins.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.85,\n      \"profit_target\": 1131.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1080.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1080 on 3-minute candle, confirming breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 300.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Target mean reversion back to EMA20 levels. Use tight stops below recent lows to manage risk.\n\n**Best Opportunities**:\n1. **ETH** - RSI(7) at 10.29, massive volume, 5.4% below EMA20\n2. **DOGE** - RSI(7) at 10.70, explosive volume (3.4x average), 7% below EMA20\n3. **XRP** - RSI(7) at 12.08, volume spike, clear support level\n\n**Position Sizing**: Risk ~$500-600 per position (5-6% of capital) with 15x leverage on most oversold assets.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 3950.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3720.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3720 or RSI(7) drops below 8 indicating further capitulation\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 550.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 28000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.1900,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.1770,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.1770 or volume spike continues without bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 520.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1800.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.56,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.40,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.40 on 3-minute candle or breaks recent support\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

RSI(7) readings below 12 are rare and typically precede strong bounces. However, the risk is that this could be the start of a deeper correction.\n\n**Risk/Reward Analysis:**\n- **PRO**: Extreme oversold conditions, high probability of technical bounce\n- **CON**: Strong downtrend momentum, no clear reversal signals yet\n- **CON**: All coins moving together suggests systematic risk\n\n## Decision: WAIT FOR REVERSAL CONFIRMATION\n\nWhile the oversold conditions are extreme, I need to see at least one of these reversal signals before entering:\n1. RSI divergence (price makes new low, RSI doesn't)\n2. Price closes above EMA20\n3. MACD shows bullish crossover\n4. Volume surge on green candle\n\n**Current situation**: Prices are still falling with no reversal pattern. Entering now would be \"catching a falling knife.\"\n\n**Portfolio Status**: -2.96% total return, Sharpe ratio -1.366. Need to preserve capital and wait for higher-probability setups.\n\n**Strategy**: Remain in cash and monitor for reversal signals in the next few candles. If we see a strong bounce with volume, consider entering ETH or BTC (most liquid) with tight stops.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

All coins hit extreme oversold conditions (RSI 7-14 range) and are now bouncing\n2. Current RSI readings (32-43 range) suggest potential short-term relief rally\n3. All prices remain below their EMA20, indicating downtrend intact\n4. MACD still deeply negative across all assets\n5. Volume is below average, suggesting weak conviction in moves\n\n**Risk Considerations:**\n1. This appears to be a relief bounce within a larger downtrend\n2. No clear reversal signals yet (still below EMAs, MACD negative)\n3. Could be a dead-cat bounce or start of recovery\n4. Given my negative performance, I need to be selective and risk-aware\n\n## Trading Strategy Decision\n\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions and current bounce, I see two potential approaches:\n\n**Option A (Conservative):** Wait for clearer reversal signals - prices above EMA20, MACD turning positive\n**Option B (Opportunistic):** Enter small positions on the bounce with tight stops, targeting short-term relief rally\n\nGiven:\n- Extreme RSI bottoms (6-12 range) rarely sustained\n- Current bounce showing momentum (RSI 32-43)\n- Tight risk management possible with recent lows as stops\n- Need to recover from -2.96% drawdown\n\n**Decision: Take selective long positions on ETH and SOL** - both showing strongest RSI recovery and have clear recent support levels for tight stops.\n\n## Position Sizing\nWith $9,704 available, I'll risk ~$300-400 per position (3-4% account risk each):\n- **ETH**: Entry 3803.70, targeting bounce to 3950-4000 zone\n- **SOL**: Entry 184.62, targeting bounce to 192-195 zone\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.3,\n      \"profit_target\": 3980.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3680.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3680 (below recent low of 3688), confirming downtrend continuation\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 380.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 21.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 193.5,\n      \"stop_loss\": 177.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 177 (below recent low of 179), confirming downtrend continuation\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.60,\n      \"risk_usd\": 350.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
