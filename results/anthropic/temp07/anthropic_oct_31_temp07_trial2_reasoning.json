I need to analyze the market conditions across all coins to identify the best entry opportunities.\n\n## Market Overview Analysis\n\n**BTC (109160.00):**\n- Price well below EMA20 (111104.55) - bearish short-term\n- MACD deeply negative (-1429.362) - strong bearish momentum\n- RSI(7) at 43.856 - recovering from oversold but still weak\n- RSI(14) at 37.402 - below neutral, indicating weakness\n- Price dropped from 111268 to 108211, now recovering to 109160\n- Below both 20 and 50 EMA on 4H timeframe (111104 vs 112838)\n- Volume significantly below average (3548 vs 7856) - weak participation\n- Assessment: In downtrend but showing potential bottoming signs. Too risky for entry now.\n\n**ETH (3930.90):**\n- Price below EMA20 (4023.44) - bearish\n- MACD negative (-71.784) but improving slightly from -72.725\n- RSI(7) at 45.554 - neutral, recovering from 21.372 low\n- RSI(14) at 39.958 - approaching neutral\n- Sharp drop from 4061 to 3864, now recovering to 3930\n- Below both EMAs on 4H (4023 vs 4114)\n- Volume well below average (52185 vs 135853)\n- Assessment: Similar pattern to BTC, in recovery but not confirmed yet.\n\n**SOL (186.91):**\n- Price significantly below EMA20 (195.30) - strong bearish\n- MACD negative (-5.057) and deteriorating\n- RSI(7) at 35.557 - weak but recovering from 19.011\n- RSI(14) at 32.649 - oversold territory\n- Dropped from 197 to 184.76, slight recovery to 186.91\n- Below both EMAs (195.30 vs 201.15)\n- Volume significantly below average (464414 vs 1197511)\n- Assessment: Weak momentum, still in downtrend.\n\n**BNB (1149.30):**\n- Price well below EMA20 (1188.16) - bearish\n- MACD negative (-31.536) but slightly improving\n- RSI(7) at 37.756 - weak, recovering from 13.516 extreme low\n- RSI(14) at 32.619 - oversold\n- Dropped from 1183 to 1134, recovering to 1149\n- Below both EMAs (1188 vs 1231)\n- Volume extremely low (4336 vs 19293)\n- Assessment: Oversold but weak volume suggests no strong buying interest.\n\n**XRP (2.36):**\n- Price below EMA20 (2.44) - bearish\n- MACD negative (-0.058) and stable\n- RSI(7) at 41.475 - neutral, recovering from 20.237\n- RSI(14) at 35.063 - slightly oversold\n- Dropped from 2.45 to 2.33, recovering to 2.36\n- Below both EMAs (2.44 vs 2.51)\n- Volume above average (13076200 vs 10321690) - interesting divergence\n- Assessment: Showing relative strength with above-average volume despite price weakness.\n\n**DOGE (0.190230):**\n- Price below EMA20 (0.198261) - bearish\n- MACD negative (-0.005) and deteriorating\n- RSI(7) at 37.342 - weak, recovering from 18.498\n- RSI(14) at 32.667 - oversold\n- Dropped from 0.200260 to 0.187720, recovering to 0.190230\n- Below both EMAs (0.198261 vs 0.204847)\n- Volume well below average (16194734 vs 67545594)\n- Assessment: Weak with poor volume.\n\n## Trading Decision\n\n**Market Condition:** All coins are in short-term downtrends with prices below their EMAs and negative MACD readings. However, all are showing RSI recovery from extreme oversold levels, suggesting potential bottoming action.\n\n**Best Opportunity - XRP:**\nXRP stands out because:\n1. Volume is ABOVE average (13M vs 10.3M) - showing buying interest during the dip\n2. RSI recovering from extreme oversold (20.237 to 41.475)\n3. Smallest gap to EMA20 (2.36 vs 2.44 = 3.3% gap)\n4. Price stabilizing around 2.36 after bounce from 2.33\n\n**Trade Setup for XRP:**\n- Entry: 2.36 (current price)\n- Stop-loss: 2.28 (below recent low of 2.33, allowing for volatility)\n- Profit target: 2.52 (above EMA20 at 2.44, targeting resistance)\n- Risk: $2.36 - $2.28 = $0.08 per unit (3.4% risk)\n- Reward: $2.52 - $2.36 = $0.16 per unit (6.8% reward)\n- Risk/Reward: 1:2 ratio\n- Invalidation: If price closes below 2.28 on 3-minute candle (below recent support structure)\n\n**Position Sizing:**\n- Risk per trade: $500 (5% of capital)\n- Risk per unit: $0.08\n- Leverage: 15x (moderate given volatility)\n- Quantity: ($500 / $0.08) / 15 = 417 XRP\n- Position value: 417 * $2.36 = $984.12\n- Margin required: $984.12 / 15 = $65.61\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 417,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.52,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.28,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.28 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown of support structure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

RSI readings in the teens indicate panic selling and extreme oversold conditions that typically precede sharp mean-reversion bounces.\n\n**Trading Strategy:** \nGiven the extreme oversold conditions (multiple coins with RSI < 20, BNB at RSI 9.5!), this presents a high-probability mean-reversion opportunity. However, I need to be cautious:\n\n1. **Risk Management:** Will use tight stop-losses below recent lows\n2. **Position Sizing:** Moderate leverage (15x) to capture bounce while managing risk\n3. **Coin Selection:** BNB shows the most extreme oversold (RSI 9.5) - highest probability bounce\n4. **Entry Timing:** Immediate entry to capture bounce from extreme levels\n\n**BNB Trade Setup:**\n- Entry: $1,062.60\n- Rationale: RSI(7) at 9.5 is historically unprecedented - extreme panic selling\n- Risk: $500 (5% of capital)\n- Stop-loss: $1,035 (2.6% below entry) - below recent panic low\n- Profit target: $1,140 (7.3% gain) - conservative target toward EMA20\n- Invalidation: If price breaks below $1,035, the crash is continuing\n- Leverage: 15x for optimal risk/reward on mean reversion\n- Quantity: ~$500 * 15 / $1,062.60 = ~7.07 BNB\n\nThis is a tactical bounce play, not a trend-following trade. The extreme RSI readings suggest a high-probability short-term reversal.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 7.07,\n      \"profit_target\": 1140.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1035.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,035 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued crash rather than bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

All major cryptos are in freefall with extremely oversold RSI readings\n2. BNB's RSI at 18.2 indicates panic selling, but this could continue lower\n3. The position is barely profitable (+0.81%) with 15x leverage exposure\n4. Market-wide selling pressure suggests this could be a dead-cat bounce\n5. However, the invalidation condition has NOT been met yet\n\nThe prudent approach with high leverage (15x) in such volatile conditions is to respect the invalidation condition strictly. Since price has NOT closed below $1,035, the position should be held according to the exit plan. However, given the extreme market weakness and minimal profit, I'm watching this very closely.\n\n**DECISION: HOLD** - Invalidation condition not met, but monitoring closely for any 3-minute close below $1,035.\n\n## New Position Opportunities\n\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions across all assets, this could present buying opportunities. However:\n- Market structure is broken (all below EMA20)\n- No signs of reversal yet (MACD still declining)\n- High volatility and leverage risk\n- Already have exposure via BNB position\n\n**DECISION: NO NEW POSITIONS** - Wait for signs of stabilization/reversal before entering new trades.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 7.07,\n      \"profit_target\": 1140.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1035.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,035 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued crash rather than bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

RSI remains in extreme oversold territory (20.752), suggesting selling pressure continues\n2. MACD continues to deteriorate (-22.672), showing no signs of reversal\n3. Price remains well below EMA20, indicating downtrend intact\n4. The bounce from $1,062.60 to $1,074 is minimal (+1.07%) - not convincing\n5. Volume is below average (13,223 vs 17,472), suggesting weak buying interest\n\n**Invalidation Check:**\nThe invalidation condition states \"If price closes below $1,035 on 3-minute candle.\" Current price is $1,074, so this has NOT been triggered yet. However, with only $39 cushion to the stop-loss and extremely weak technicals, the risk is elevated.\n\n**Risk Management Decision:**\nGiven the 15x leverage and deteriorating technical conditions, I should consider taking the profit now rather than risking a reversal. The RSI at 20.752 could bounce, but the MACD trend and price action suggest this is more likely a dead cat bounce than a true reversal. With $76.84 profit on a $500 risk position, that's a 15.4% gain - a reasonable take-profit scenario.\n\nHowever, the invalidation condition has NOT been met, and the stop-loss at $1,035 provides protection. The proper disciplined approach is to HOLD until either the stop-loss is hit or the invalidation condition triggers.\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- BTC: RSI 39.583, MACD -1257.721 - Oversold but no clear reversal. Price at $106,821 well below EMA20 at $109,340. Not entering.\n- ETH: RSI 33.917, MACD -49.574 - Similar bearish picture. Not entering.\n- SOL: RSI 41.565, MACD -3.878 - Slightly better but still below EMA20. Not entering.\n- XRP: RSI 42.797, MACD -0.044 - Showing some stabilization but no clear entry. Not entering.\n- DOGE: RSI 42.470, MACD -0.004 - Similar to XRP. Not entering.\n\nMarket appears to be in a correction phase across all assets. No new positions warranted.\n\n**Final Decision for BNB:**\nHOLD - The invalidation condition has not been met (price is above $1,035), and the stop-loss provides protection. While technicals are weak, discipline requires following the exit plan rather than emotional decision-making based on fear.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 7.07,\n      \"profit_target\": 1140.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1035.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,035 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued crash rather than bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, I need to examine the quality of this position:\n\n1. **Extreme oversold conditions**: RSI at 17.929 suggests potential for a bounce, which is what I was trading\n2. **Weak bounce**: The recovery from $1,062.60 to $1,066.10 is minimal ($3.50)\n3. **Deteriorating momentum**: MACD continues to worsen (-33.538)\n4. **Below all EMAs**: Price is $75 below EMA20, indicating strong downtrend\n5. **Low volume**: Below-average volume suggests weak buying interest\n6. **Small profit**: Only +$20.99 unrealized gain\n\n**Risk Management Consideration:**\nWhile the invalidation condition hasn't been technically met, the market structure is concerning:\n- The bounce is weak and unconvincing\n- Volume is low, suggesting lack of conviction\n- MACD continues deteriorating\n- We're only $31.10 away from the stop-loss ($1,066.10 - $1,035 = $31.10)\n- The profit target at $1,140 seems increasingly unrealistic given the $75 gap to even reach EMA20\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION**\nReason: While the invalidation hasn't been technically triggered, this is a weak bounce with deteriorating momentum. The risk/reward has shifted unfavorably. Taking the small profit now (+$20.99) is prudent risk management rather than holding for a $1,140 target that looks increasingly unlikely. The extremely low RSI could lead to further capitulation before any meaningful recovery.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- **BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE**: All showing similar patterns - prices below EMAs, negative MACD, oversold RSI, downtrending.

Let me analyze the market conditions for potential entry opportunities:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $106,396 vs EMA20: $108,967 (trading below EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 35.05 (oversold territory, potential bounce)\n- RSI(14): 32.18 (deeply oversold)\n- MACD: -1589 (strongly negative, downtrend)\n- Price dropped from $111,405 to $106,396 (-4.5% decline)\n- Below both 20 and 50 EMA on 4H timeframe\n- Volume: 3,351 vs avg 7,737 (low volume on decline)\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,830.70 vs EMA20: $3,926.09 (below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 45.61 (neutral, recovering from 20s)\n- RSI(14): 38.48 (approaching oversold)\n- MACD: -73.77 (negative but showing slight recovery)\n- Price dropped from $4,061 to $3,830 (-5.7% decline)\n- Showing some stabilization and recovery attempt\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $181.89 vs EMA20: $188.83 (below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 38.26 (oversold)\n- RSI(14): 34.58 (oversold)\n- MACD: -4.57 (negative)\n- Price dropped from $196.80 to $181.89 (-7.6% decline)\n- Severe weakness\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,070.60 vs EMA20: $1,133.20 (significantly below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 25.06 (deeply oversold)\n- RSI(14): 22.80 (extremely oversold)\n- MACD: -33.56 (very negative)\n- Price dropped from $1,180.90 to $1,070.60 (-9.3% decline)\n- Most oversold of all assets\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.29 vs EMA20: $2.37 (below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 39.82 (oversold)\n- RSI(14): 36.04 (oversold)\n- MACD: -0.050 (negative)\n- Price dropped from $2.45 to $2.29 (-6.5% decline)\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.18472 vs EMA20: $0.19141 (below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 43.47 (neutral, recovering)\n- RSI(14): 37.23 (approaching oversold)\n- MACD: -0.005 (slightly negative)\n- Price dropped from $0.20026 to $0.18472 (-7.8% decline)\n\n## Trading Decision Logic\n\nAll assets are in downtrends, trading below their EMAs with negative MACD. However, multiple assets show deeply oversold RSI conditions which could indicate potential mean reversion opportunities:\n\n1. **BNB** - Most oversold (RSI 7: 25.06, RSI 14: 22.80), but also showing the most severe weakness (-9.3% drop). High risk.\n\n2. **BTC** - Oversold (RSI 7: 35.05, RSI 14: 32.18), relatively lower volume on decline suggests potential exhaustion. More stable than altcoins.\n\n3. **ETH** - RSI recovering from extreme lows (was at 20.57, now 45.61 on 7-period). Shows stabilization attempt.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- All assets in confirmed downtrends\n- This is a counter-trend trade opportunity (mean reversion play)\n- Need tight stop-losses due to downtrend risk\n- Best opportunity: BTC due to relative stability and deep oversold condition\n\n**Trade Plan:**\nI'll take ONE position in **BTC** as a mean reversion play:\n- Entry: $106,396\n- Stop-loss: $104,500 (1.78% below entry, below recent low of $105,589)\n- Profit target: $109,500 (2.92% above entry, below EMA20 resistance)\n- Leverage: 15x (moderate for this risky counter-trend trade)\n- Risk: ~$250 (2.5% of portfolio)\n- Invalidation: If price closes below $104,500 (confirming continued breakdown)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.035,\n      \"profit_target\": 109500.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 104500.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $104,500 on 3-minute candle, confirming breakdown continuation\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 250.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price is $2,149 above the $104,500 stop-loss level. While we're in a downtrend (price below EMA20, negative MACD), the technical indicators show potential stabilization:\n- RSI recovered from extreme oversold (17.62) to neutral (42.15)\n- MACD improving (-1407 vs -1465)\n- Price bounced and holding above key support\n\nHowever, the position is barely profitable and we're in a weak market structure. The prudent decision is to HOLD and let the stop-loss protect us if the invalidation level breaks. We need more confirmation before exiting - either hit profit target at $109,500 or invalidation at $104,500.\n\n### Other Coins - No Positions\n- **ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE**: No existing positions to manage\n- Market showing recovery signs across altcoins (RSI improving, MACD improving)\n- However, with limited capital ($9,711 available) and existing BTC position, maintaining focus on risk management\n- Not entering new positions given uncertain market conditions and need to preserve capital\n\n## Risk Management Assessment\n- Current account value: $9,967.45\n- Total return: -0.33%\n- Available cash: $9,711.60\n- BTC position notional: $3,732.72 (37.4% of account)\n- Risk on BTC position: $250 (2.5% of account) - appropriate sizing\n\n**Conclusion**: HOLD BTC position.

Current price is $107,143, and recent lows were $105,671. The invalidation condition is NOT met.

Evaluating for potential new entries:\n\n- **ETH**: Price $3,887 near EMA20 ($3,891), MACD improving (-23.9), RSI(7) 61 - neutral/slight bullish. However, below 50-EMA resistance. Not compelling enough for entry.\n\n- **SOL**: Price $187.47 above EMA20 ($186.90), MACD improving (-1.92), RSI(7) 71 - overbought territory. Showing strength but extended. Too risky to chase.\n\n- **BNB**: Price $1,092 well below EMA20 ($1,112), MACD negative (-17.8), RSI(7) 44.7 - weak. Clear downtrend. No entry signal.\n\n- **XRP**: Price $2.36 slightly above EMA20 ($2.35), MACD improving (-0.011), RSI(7) 57.3 - neutral. Consolidating but no clear directional bias.\n\n- **DOGE**: Price $0.18947 at EMA20 ($0.18923), MACD improving (-0.002), RSI(7) 72.7 - overbought. Similar to SOL, extended.

Too extended to enter.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $4,025.50 (strong rally +3.9% from recent levels)\n- RSI(7): 90.33 - CRITICALLY overbought (highest reading)\n- RSI(14): 81.21 - Extreme overbought\n- MACD: 28.80 - Strong positive but at peak levels\n- Price above EMA20 ($3,916.90) by 2.8% - overextended\n- Volume: 125,261 vs avg 90,063 - High volume but overbought\n- **Assessment:** Most overbought of all coins. Extreme reversal risk. No entry.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $191.14 (moderate rally +3.4%)\n- RSI(7): 70.36 - Overbought but not extreme\n- RSI(14): 66.55 - Approaching overbought\n- MACD: 1.39 - Positive and rising\n- Price above EMA20 ($186.75) by 2.4% - extended but manageable\n- Volume: 891,758 vs avg 728,045 - Good volume confirmation\n- **Assessment:** Least overbought major coin. Momentum intact but extended.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,127.90 (strong recovery +4.2% from lows)\n- RSI(7): 73.78 - Overbought\n- RSI(14): 63.88 - Neutral to overbought\n- MACD: -3.65 - Still negative despite rally (bearish divergence)\n- Price above EMA20 ($1,108.42) by 1.8% - moderate extension\n- Volume: 5,844 vs avg 8,207 - BELOW average (weak confirmation)\n- **Assessment:** MACD still negative despite price rally = bearish divergence. Weak volume. Risky.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.43 (strong move +3.4%)\n- RSI(7): 80.88 - Overbought\n- RSI(14): 72.77 - Overbought\n- MACD: 0.022 - Positive but small magnitude\n- Price above EMA20 ($2.36) by 3.0% - extended\n- Volume: 10,543,446 vs avg 6,122,996 - Very high volume (+72%)\n- **Assessment:** Overbought but strong volume.

High risk.\n\n## Trading Decision\n\n**ALL MARKETS ARE OVERBOUGHT.** This is a dangerous environment for new long entries:\n- BTC RSI(7) = 86.83\n- ETH RSI(7) = 90.33 (extreme)\n- SOL RSI(7) = 70.36\n- BNB RSI(7) = 73.78\n- XRP RSI(7) = 80.88\n- DOGE RSI(7) = 81.81\n\n**Risk Management Considerations:**\n1. We've just achieved positive returns (0.42%) with excellent Sharpe (4.85)\n2. Entering at these extreme levels risks giving back gains\n3. Better to wait for pullback or consolidation\n4. Preservation of capital is priority\n\n**Conclusion:** NO NEW POSITIONS. All coins are overbought with RSI(7) > 70. The market needs to cool off before safe entry points emerge. I will not chase parabolic moves at extreme RSI levels - this violates sound risk management principles.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

Price above EMA20 confirming uptrend\n4. If we get continuation, SOL has room to run before hitting critical overbought\n\n**Risk Management for SOL Entry:**\n- Entry: $192.93\n- Stop-loss: $185.00 (below recent low of $185.81 and EMA20 support)\n- Profit target: $202.00 (4.7% gain, reasonable given momentum)\n- Risk: $7.93 per coin (4.1% risk)\n- Position size: $500 risk / $7.93 = 63 SOL\n- Leverage: 12x (moderate given conditions)\n- Invalidation: Price closes below $186.50 on 3-minute candle (EMA20 breakdown)\n\nThis is a momentum continuation play with tight risk management given the late-stage overbought conditions across the broader market.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 63,\n      \"profit_target\": 202.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 185.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $186.50 on 3-minute candle (EMA20 breakdown)\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Current price is $192.11 and EMA20 is $186.80. The price has NOT broken below $186.50, so the invalidation condition is NOT met.\n\n**Recent Price Action:**\nLooking at the 3-minute candles: [187.47, 186.90, 185.81, 188.86, 190.67, 188.81, 187.77, 191.14, 192.93, 192.11]\n- We entered at the peak ($192.93)\n- Current pullback to $192.11 is minor (-0.42%)\n- The lowest recent price was $185.81 (which touched near invalidation but didn't close below $186.50)\n- Price has recovered and is consolidating around $192\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n- Invalidation NOT triggered (price above $186.50)\n- Stop-loss at $185.00 not hit\n- Technical indicators remain bullish (MACD positive, RSI healthy)\n- EMA20 trending upward (from 182.23 to 186.80)\n- Price action shows resilience after brief dip\n- Small unrealized loss (-0.42%) is acceptable within normal volatility\n\n**DECISION: HOLD** - All conditions remain favorable. The position has room to work toward the $202 profit target.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n### BTC\n- Extremely overbought: RSI(7) = 85.817, RSI(14) = 83.759\n- Strong momentum but extended move (+3.6% from $107,143 to $110,996)\n- Already have SOL exposure; don't want to add risk at overbought levels\n- **No position, not entering**\n\n### ETH\n- RSI(7) = 74.557, RSI(14) = 79.551 - moderately overbought\n- Strong uptrend but similar to BTC, extended\n- Price $4,033.50 vs EMA20 $3,920.82 (+2.9%)\n- **No position, not entering**\n\n### BNB\n- RSI(7) = 50.811 - neutral, not compelling\n- Recent pullback from $1,127.90 to $1,114.60\n- Less clear directional bias\n- **No position, not entering**\n\n### XRP\n- RSI(7) = 75.136 - overbought\n- Strong move from $2.36 to $2.46 (+4.2%)\n- Extended, would prefer entry on pullback\n- **No position, not entering**\n\n### DOGE\n- RSI(7) = 75.675 - overbought\n- Price $0.200190 vs EMA20 $0.191467 (+4.6%)\n- Extended move, high risk at current levels\n- **No position, not entering**\n\n## Risk Management Summary\n- Current account value: $9,973.55\n- Available cash: $9,022.71\n- SOL position notional: $12,102.93 (12x leverage)\n- Unrealized loss: -$57.74 (-0.58% of account)\n- Portfolio return: -0.26%\n\nThe single SOL position represents manageable risk with clear exit parameters.

The invalidation condition has NOT been met - price remains comfortably above $186.50 and EMA20 is at $187.66. The uptrend structure is intact with price above rising EMA20. RSI cooling from overbought levels (was 82.389, now 50.532) is healthy and creates room for another leg up. MACD remains positive.\n\n**Risk Management:**\n- Position is down only 1.31% with 12x leverage\n- Stop-loss at $185.00 provides 2.84% downside protection\n- Invalidation at $186.50 is well below current price\n- No signs of trend breakdown yet\n\n**Decision: HOLD**\nThe invalidation condition is NOT met. Price remains above $186.50 and EMA20. The pullback from $192.93 to $190.41 is normal consolidation. The uptrend structure remains intact. RSI has cooled to neutral levels, providing room for another move higher toward the $202 profit target.\n\n**Other Coins - No New Positions:**\n- **BTC**: RSI at 86.55 - extremely overbought, risky entry\n- **ETH**: RSI dropped from 93.793 to 52.543 - sharp reversal, unclear direction\n- **BNB**: RSI at 43.947 - weak momentum, no clear setup\n- **XRP**: RSI at 77.225 - overbought, risk of pullback\n- **DOGE**: RSI at 65.052 - no compelling setup\n\nNot entering new positions due to lack of clear, low-risk setups.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 63.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 202.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 185.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $186.50 on 3-minute candle (EMA20 breakdown)\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Underwater by $268\n2. Showing weakening momentum (RSI dropping to 37.96, MACD declining)\n3. In a short-term downtrend (peaked at $192.93, now at $188.77)\n4. Close to testing the invalidation level ($188.77 vs $186.50 = only $2.27 buffer)\n\nGiven the deteriorating technical picture and proximity to invalidation, I will **HOLD** but remain vigilant. The oversold RSI(7) at 37.96 suggests potential for a bounce, and we're still above both the EMA20 and invalidation level.\n\n## Market Opportunities\n\n**BTC:** Strong uptrend (price $110,753 vs EMA20 $108,753), but RSI(7) at 70.25 shows overbought. MACD strong at 1055. Would consider entry on pullback.\n\n**ETH:** Price $3,980 above EMA20 $3,939, but RSI(7) dropped to 40.56 from overbought levels - showing weakness after rejection.\n\n**XRP:** Explosive move! Price $2.52 vs EMA20 $2.40 (+5%). RSI(7) at 89.38 extremely overbought. Too extended for entry.\n\n**DOGE:** Price $0.1995 above EMA20 $0.1937. RSI(7) at 66.69 - healthy. Uptrend intact but already have SOL exposure.\n\n**BNB:** Price $1,100.90 slightly below EMA20 $1,101.76. RSI(7) at 32.17 oversold. Potential bounce but weak momentum.\n\n**Conclusion:** Will hold SOL position as invalidation not triggered and oversold RSI suggests potential bounce. No new positions given existing exposure and mixed market signals.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 63.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 202.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 185.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $186.50 on 3-minute candle (EMA20 breakdown)\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Current price is $189.64, well above this level, and EMA20 is at $187.99. The position is experiencing normal volatility within the trade plan parameters. MACD remains positive, RSI is neutral (not oversold anymore), and price is maintaining above the key EMA20 support. \n\nWhile the position is underwater, this is expected variance in a leveraged trade. The stop-loss at $185.00 provides adequate protection. The technical structure remains intact with no breakdown signals.\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - Continue monitoring. Will close if price breaks below $186.50 or hits stop-loss at $185.00.\n\n**Other Coins - No New Positions:**\n- BTC: Strong but already extended (RSI was 91.9 recently, now 58.7 cooling off)\n- ETH: Showing weakness with RSI 39.2, pulling back after overbought\n- BNB: Weak momentum, RSI 31.4, declining\n- XRP: Strong move but already up significantly, RSI 66\n- DOGE: Overbought territory, RSI 70, risky entry\n\nNo compelling setups for new positions.

Not entering - waiting for stabilization.\n- **ETH**: RSI(7) at 20.020 - extremely oversold, price $3,922.60 below EMA20 $3,944.83. Sharp decline but no position to manage.\n- **BNB**: RSI(7) at 16.018 - extremely oversold, major selloff from $1,127.90 to $1,081.30. Too risky to enter.\n- **XRP**: RSI(7) at 45.061, price $2.45 above EMA20 $2.41. Most stable but still showing weakness. Not compelling enough.\n- **DOGE**: RSI(7) at 33.772, sharp drop from $0.20115 to $0.19652. Bearish momentum.\n\n**Market Context:** Broad-based selloff across all coins with extremely low RSI readings. This suggests a market-wide correction.

I need to identify high-probability setups.\n\n### Market-Wide Observation\nAll major coins are showing sharp pullbacks with extremely oversold RSI readings:\n- BTC: RSI(7) = 18.02 (extremely oversold)\n- ETH: RSI(7) = 14.59 (extremely oversold)\n- SOL: RSI(7) = 22.17 (oversold)\n- BNB: RSI(7) = 11.74 (extremely oversold)\n- XRP: RSI(7) = 35.45 (approaching oversold)\n- DOGE: RSI(7) = 22.81 (oversold)\n\nThis represents a coordinated market-wide selloff after the recent rally. All coins were overbought (RSI 85-93) just 15-30 minutes ago and have now crashed.\n\n### Individual Coin Analysis\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Price: $108,019 (down from $111,161 high)\n- Below EMA20 ($108,879) - bearish short-term\n- RSI(7): 18.02 - EXTREMELY oversold (typically reversal zone)\n- RSI(14): 35.28 - also oversold\n- MACD declining from 1003 to 691 - momentum weakening\n- Volume elevated (9165 vs avg 3976) - selling pressure\n- Assessment: Extreme oversold but momentum still negative. Could bounce but risky.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Price: $3,891.90 (down from $4,053 high)\n- Below EMA20 ($3,945) - bearish\n- RSI(7): 14.59 - MOST oversold of all coins\n- RSI(14): 30.72 - oversold\n- MACD declining: 19.76 from 40.07\n- Volume: 109,088 vs avg 71,049 - high selling\n- Assessment: Most extreme oversold condition. High probability of bounce.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Price: $184.93 (down from $192.93)\n- Below EMA20 ($187.86) - bearish\n- RSI(7): 22.17 - oversold\n- MACD: 0.615 - weakening\n- Volume elevated\n- Assessment: Oversold but less extreme than BTC/ETH\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Price: $1,071.30 (down from $1,127.90)\n- Below EMA20 ($1,099.19) - bearish\n- RSI(7): 11.74 - SECOND most oversold\n- RSI(14): 26.74 - very oversold\n- MACD: -0.513 (negative) - bearish momentum\n- Assessment: Extremely oversold but MACD negative is concerning\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Price: $2.43 (relatively stable)\n- Above EMA20 ($2.42) - still bullish structure\n- RSI(7): 35.45 - least oversold\n- RSI(14): 47.79 - neutral\n- MACD: 0.032 - still positive\n- Volume: 13.38M vs avg 4.57M - massive volume spike\n- Assessment: Strongest relative strength, holding above EMA\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Price: $0.19416 (down from $0.20115)\n- Below EMA20 ($0.19476) - bearish\n- RSI(7): 22.81 - oversold\n- MACD: 0.003 - weak positive\n- Assessment: Oversold but weak structure\n\n### Trading Decision Logic\n\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions across the board, I'm looking for mean-reversion bounce plays. However, the momentum is still bearish (prices below EMAs, MACD declining).\n\n**Best Setup: ETH**\n- Most extreme oversold (RSI 14.59)\n- Historically, RSI below 15 often leads to sharp bounces\n- Clear risk/reward with stop below recent low\n- Tight stop-loss possible given the extreme reading\n\n**Alternative: XRP**\n- Showing relative strength (holding above EMA20)\n- Least damaged in the selloff\n- Positive MACD, massive volume\n- Could lead the bounce\n\n**Risk Management:**\n- Position size: ~$500-600 risk per trade (5-6% of account)\n- Leverage: 15x for quick scalp given extreme conditions\n- Tight stops given volatility\n\nI'll enter ETH for the oversold bounce with tight risk management.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.3,\n      \"profit_target\": 3960.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3865.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,865 or RSI(7) drops below 10, indicating continued breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 598.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The price is holding above the stop-loss at $3,865. However, the extreme oversold condition (RSI 14.200) could signal either:\n1. Imminent bounce (oversold reversal)\n2.

Current price at $2.4209 is dangerously close to both the stop-loss ($2.40) and the invalidation condition. Looking at the recent price action:\n- Latest prices: [2.52, 2.49, 2.42] - clear downtrend\n- Current price $2.4209 is only $0.0209 (0.86%) above stop-loss\n- RSI(7) at 36.136 shows bearish momentum\n- RSI(14) at 44.270 confirms weakness\n- MACD declining from 0.030 to 0.025\n- Price below EMA20 ($2.44), which was the invalidation reference\n\n**Key Technical Observations:**\n1. Price has broken below the EMA20 ($2.44) - this is bearish\n2. The invalidation was specifically tied to closing below $2.40 on EMA20 level\n3. We're now at $2.4209, just 0.86% from that critical level\n4. With 12x leverage, a move to $2.40 would trigger stop-loss\n5. Liquidation price is $2.31, giving limited room for error\n\n**Risk Management Considerations:**\n- Already down -$255.90 on this trade\n- Portfolio is down -16.49% overall\n- Sharpe ratio of -13.599 indicates poor risk-adjusted returns\n- With only $8,102 cash available and $8,350 total account value, this loss represents 3% of total capital\n\n**Market Context:**\nAll major coins (BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, DOGE) are showing similar bearish patterns:\n- RSI(7) readings all in 27-36 range (oversold but still falling)\n- Prices below their respective EMA20s\n- MACD indicators weakening\n- This suggests broad market weakness, not XRP-specific\n\n**Decision:**\nThe invalidation condition hasn't been technically met yet (price hasn't closed below $2.40), but we're extremely close. However, the spirit of the invalidation is violated - price is below the EMA20 level that was our reference point. The risk/reward here is poor:\n- Upside: Maybe $0.02-0.03 to profit target at $2.65 (10% gain needed)\n- Downside: $0.02 to stop-loss (immediate)\n\nGiven the precarious position, weak technicals, and broad market weakness, I should **CLOSE** this position to preserve capital. We're too close to stop-loss with deteriorating momentum.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, DOGE: All showing oversold conditions (RSI 27-36) but still in downtrends. Not entering new positions in a falling market with poor portfolio performance.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 2500.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.65,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.4,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.40 (EMA20 level) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 450.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - price at $2.4209 is only 0.86% above stop-loss ($2.40) with deteriorating technicals. Price has broken below EMA20 ($2.44) reference level, RSI showing continued weakness at 36.1, and MACD declining. With 12x leverage and -$255.90 unrealized loss, risk/reward is unfavorable.

Recently rejected from highs. Too risky after sharp moves.\n\n**ETH (3,857.10)**\n- Price below EMA20 (3,941.92) - bearish\n- RSI(7): 32.167 - oversold\n- RSI(14): 37.760 - oversold\n- MACD near zero (2.182) - momentum fading\n- Similar pattern to BTC: spike to 4,082.90 then sharp decline\n- Volume: 75,753 vs avg 99,890 - significantly below average (concerning)\n- Assessment: Oversold but weak volume suggests lack of conviction. Wait for confirmation.\n\n**SOL (185.16)**\n- Price below EMA20 (188.66) - bearish\n- RSI(7): 35.069 - oversold\n- RSI(14): 40.803 - approaching oversold\n- MACD near zero (0.061) - momentum dying\n- Pattern: spike to 196.14, then rejection\n- Volume: 597,361 vs avg 621,978 - below average\n- Assessment: Oversold but no clear reversal signal yet.\n\n**BNB (1,067.00)**\n- Price significantly below EMA20 (1,090.85) - bearish\n- RSI(7): 38.218 - oversold\n- RSI(14): 39.106 - oversold\n- MACD negative (-5.814) - bearish momentum\n- Volume: 11,012 vs avg 6,795 - elevated (61% above average) - interesting!\n- Assessment: Most oversold of major coins with elevated volume. Potential capitulation/reversal setup.\n\n**XRP (2.42)**\n- Price near EMA20 (2.43) - neutral\n- RSI(7): 35.584 - oversold\n- RSI(14): 43.960 - neutral\n- MACD positive (0.021) but declining\n- Volume: 5,384,792 vs avg 5,992,812 - below average\n- Assessment: Relatively strongest position vs EMA but still weak.\n\n**DOGE (0.193670)**\n- Price below EMA20 (0.196050) - bearish\n- RSI(7): 34.396 - oversold\n- RSI(14): 41.730 - neutral-bearish\n- MACD positive (0.001) but minimal\n- Volume: 12,020,570 vs avg 25,055,839 - significantly below average (52% drop)\n- Assessment: Weak volume, no conviction. Avoid.\n\n## Risk Management Considerations\nGiven my -16.31% drawdown and poor Sharpe ratio, I need to be extremely selective. The market just experienced sharp volatility with spikes followed by rejections across all assets. This suggests:\n1. Potential bull trap that failed\n2. Market indecision\n3. Need to wait for clearer signals\n\n**Decision: NO NEW POSITIONS**\nAll coins are showing oversold conditions but lack clear reversal signals. After a -16.31% loss, I should not force trades. The elevated volume on BNB is interesting but insufficient alone. Better to preserve capital and wait for:\n- Clear bullish reversal patterns\n- Volume confirmation\n- Price reclaiming EMA20 levels\n\nThe prudent approach is to stay in cash and wait for higher-probability setups rather than catching falling knives in an uncertain market.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

This is a dangerous environment for new positions. However, with deeply oversold RSI readings, there's potential for a short-term bounce.\n\n**Best opportunity**: **DOGE** has the most oversold RSI(7) at 29.10, suggesting highest probability of mean reversion bounce. Will take a small, conservative position with tight risk management.\n\nAlternative consideration: Could wait for confirmation of reversal, but oversold bounces can be sharp and fast.\n\n**Risk Management**:\n- Small position size (~$800 risk = 9.6% of capital)\n- Tight stop-loss at recent lows\n- Conservative 15x leverage to limit exposure\n- Quick profit target at EMA20 resistance\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 62500,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.1958,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.1900,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $0.1900 (recent low) or if RSI(7) fails to recover above 40 within next 3 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 800.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Will monitor but not entering yet.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.40 vs EMA20: $2.43 (slightly below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 31.54 (oversold, potential bounce)\n- MACD: 0.005 (barely positive, very weak)\n- Price range-bound, minimal momentum\n- Decision: NO TRADE - weak momentum, no clear direction\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.19185 vs EMA20: $0.19538 (below EMA, bearish)\n- RSI(7): 34.75 (oversold territory)\n- MACD: -0.000 (essentially flat, no momentum)\n- Price rejected from $0.20424 spike, declining\n- Decision: NO TRADE - bearish structure, below EMA\n\n## Risk Management Considerations\nGiven the -17.11% drawdown and poor Sharpe ratio, I need to be extremely cautious. The market is showing:\n- Most coins below their EMA20 (bearish)\n- Recent spikes were rejected (failed breakouts)\n- RSI levels showing oversold conditions but no clear reversal signals\n- MACD negative or weakening on most assets\n\n**DECISION: NO NEW POSITIONS**\nThe market structure is weak across all coins. While some show oversold RSI readings, there are no clear reversal confirmations. Better to preserve capital and wait for higher-probability setups with:\n1. Price above EMA20\n2.

Let me analyze each coin for potential entry opportunities.\n\n## Market Analysis\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $108,377 vs EMA20: $108,860 (below EMA, bearish)\n- RSI(7): 51.9 (neutral, recovering from oversold)\n- MACD: -312.6 (deeply negative but stabilizing - was -313.6)\n- Price action: Sharp drop from $113,386 to $107,528, now bouncing to $108,377\n- The bounce from $107,528 shows some support, but price remains below EMA20\n- Volume below average (6,907 vs 9,145) - weak conviction\n- **Decision: WAIT** - Not clear enough recovery signal yet\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,825 vs EMA20: $3,898 (below EMA, bearish)\n- RSI(7): 40.7 (approaching oversold but not quite there)\n- MACD: -44.5 (negative and worsening)\n- Price dropped from $4,082 to $3,803, small bounce to $3,825\n- Still in downtrend, below all EMAs\n- Volume significantly below average (50,658 vs 108,042)\n- **Decision: WAIT** - Too weak, no clear reversal\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $182.79 vs EMA20: $185.90 (below EMA, bearish)\n- RSI(7): 45.8 (neutral, recovering sharply from 17.1!)\n- MACD: -1.68 (negative but improving from -1.62)\n- Price dropped from $196 to $180, now bouncing to $182.79\n- RSI recovery from extreme oversold (17.5) to 45.8 is significant\n- This is the strongest recovery signal among all coins\n- Volume below average but the RSI bounce is notable\n- **Decision: CONSIDER ENTRY** - Best technical setup for reversal\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,086.40 vs EMA20: $1,085.36 (slightly above EMA!)\n- RSI(7): 64.8 (bullish, strong recovery from 27.5)\n- MACD: -8.88 (negative but improving from -10.26)\n- Price dropped from $1,111 to $1,056, now at $1,086\n- Just crossed above EMA20 - potential bullish signal\n- RSI showing strong momentum recovery\n- Volume weak (2,454 vs 7,194)\n- **Decision: STRONG CONSIDER** - Best technical setup overall\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.38 vs EMA20: $2.41 (below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 35.8 (oversold but bouncing from 18.9)\n- MACD: -0.009 (negative and worsening)\n- Still in downtrend, weak bounce\n- **Decision: WAIT** - Not strong enough\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.1909 vs EMA20: $0.1943 (below EMA)\n- RSI(7): 39.5 (oversold territory, bouncing from 25.3)\n- MACD: -0.002 (negative)\n- Weak recovery, still below EMA\n- **Decision: WAIT** - Not compelling\n\n## Risk Management Decision\n\nGiven my -17.19% drawdown, I need to be selective. BNB shows the best technical setup:\n1. Price just crossed above EMA20 (bullish reversal signal)\n2. RSI recovered from 27.5 to 64.8 (strong momentum shift)\n3. MACD improving\n4. Most stable relative to its EMA\n\nI'll take a conservative position in BNB with tight risk management:\n- Risk: $400 (4.8% of capital)\n- Leverage: 15x (moderate)\n- Stop-loss: Below recent low at $1,056\n- Profit target: Above recent high at $1,111\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 1115.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1055.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,055 or RSI(7) drops back below 40 while price is below EMA20\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

We're only $6.30 away from profit target ($1,115)\n2. RSI(7) at 79.186 is dangerously overbought - this level typically precedes pullbacks\n3. The move from $1,056 to $1,108 was very rapid - likely to see mean reversion\n4. With 15x leverage, a small pullback could quickly eat into profits\n5. We've already captured +2.05% on 15x leverage = ~30% return on margin\n\n**Risk Assessment**:\n- At RSI(7) = 79, we're in extreme overbought territory\n- Historical pattern shows RSI(7) peaked at 79.186 and previously reversed sharply from similar levels\n- The profit target is very close, but waiting for it risks a sharp reversal\n- Better to take profits now at +$119 than risk a pullback that could turn this into a loss\n\n**Decision**: **CLOSE POSITION** - Taking profits due to extreme overbought conditions (RSI 79) and risk of imminent reversal. We've captured a solid gain and are near profit target. The risk/reward of holding for an additional $6.30 upside is poor given the overbought signals.\n\n## Other Coins - No Positions\n\n### BTC\n- Price recovering to $109,289 from recent lows\n- RSI(7) at 65.076 - moderate\n- MACD improving but still negative (-505.857)\n- Below EMA20 still, mixed signals\n- **Decision**: No entry - waiting for clearer trend confirmation\n\n### ETH\n- Price at $3,879.10, below EMA20 ($3,903.10)\n- RSI(7) at 64.111 - recovering but not strong\n- MACD still negative (-48.451)\n- **Decision**: No entry - trend not confirmed\n\n### SOL\n- Price $187.39, just above EMA20 ($186.50)\n- RSI(7) at 69.173 - getting overbought\n- Strong recovery but entering late would be risky\n- **Decision**: No entry - missed the entry point\n\n### XRP\n- Price $2.41, below EMA20 ($2.42)\n- RSI(7) at 58.180 - neutral\n- Weak momentum\n- **Decision**: No entry - no clear edge\n\n### DOGE\n- Price $0.193860, below EMA20 ($0.194756)\n- RSI(7) at 63.512 - moderate\n- MACD negative\n- **Decision**: No entry - no clear setup\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 1115.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1055.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,055 or RSI(7) drops back below 40 while price is below EMA20\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Taking profits at extreme overbought conditions - RSI(7) at 79.186 signals imminent reversal risk.

Invalidation condition NOT met - price holding well above 180.00\n2. RSI at 81.5 indicates extreme overbought conditions - high risk of pullback\n3. Profit target at 195.00 is only $3.73 away (1.95% move needed)\n4. Position is profitable (+$21.68) but RSI suggests momentum may be exhausting\n5. With 15x leverage, a small pullback could quickly erase gains\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe position is in profit and the invalidation condition has not been met. However, the RSI at 81.5 is a major concern - this level typically precedes short-term corrections. The profit target is close (195.00), but pushing for it with such extreme overbought conditions and 15x leverage is risky.\n\nGiven:\n- Extreme RSI readings (81.5)\n- Position already profitable\n- High leverage (15x) amplifies reversal risk\n- Recent strong momentum may be exhausting\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION** - Taking profits at current levels due to extreme overbought conditions. While the invalidation hasn't been hit, the risk/reward at these RSI levels with 15x leverage favors securing the gain rather than risking a reversal.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC: RSI 70.2 (overbought), no position, not entering\n- ETH: RSI 48.5 (neutral), weak momentum, no position\n- BNB: RSI 68.7 (approaching overbought), no position\n- XRP: RSI 43.4 (neutral-weak), downtrend, no position\n- DOGE: RSI 58.7 (neutral), no clear edge, no position\n\nNo new positions warranted given current market conditions and risk profile.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 6.7,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 179.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 180.00 on 3-minute candle, indicating failed reversal and breakdown of support\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 840.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Taking profits due to extreme overbought conditions (RSI 81.5) with 15x leverage - high risk of reversal from these levels despite invalidation not being met\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

While the invalidation condition specifies RSI > 85, we're at 81.663 and showing parabolic movement. The RSI has been climbing aggressively and we're seeing signs of exhaustion. With +2.5% gains and profit target nearly hit, this is an excellent exit point to lock in profits. The risk/reward is now unfavorable - risking $200+ of profit for an additional $30 to reach exact target is poor risk management.\n\n**Action**: CLOSE POSITION - Taking profits at near-target levels with extreme overbought conditions\n\n## Other Coins Analysis\n\n### BTC\n- **Current**: 113,309, **RSI-7**: 86.757, **RSI-14**: 81.269\n- Extremely overbought (RSI-7 > 85), but strong uptrend\n- No position, and conditions too extended to enter\n\n### ETH  \n- **Current**: 4,045.20, **RSI-7**: 85.973, **RSI-14**: 78.587\n- Extremely overbought, similar to BTC\n- No position, too risky to enter at these levels\n\n### BNB\n- **Current**: 1,135.10, **RSI-7**: 86.271, **RSI-14**: 71.257\n- Also extremely overbought\n- No position, avoiding entry\n\n### XRP\n- **Current**: 2.65, **RSI-7**: 94.001, **RSI-14**: 92.597\n- MOST OVERBOUGHT of all coins - dangerously extended\n- No position, absolutely avoiding\n\n### DOGE\n- **Current**: 0.201760, **RSI-7**: 80.480, **RSI-14**: 73.231\n- Overbought but less extreme than others\n- No position, market-wide overbought conditions suggest caution\n\n**Overall Market Assessment**: All coins showing extreme overbought conditions with RSI-7 readings between 80-94.

The market shows strong momentum across all assets, but most are severely overbought.\n\n**Key concerns:**\n1. BTC and ETH RSI(7) > 80 - extreme overbought\n2. Recent sharp rally suggests profit-taking likely\n3. My track record suggests I should wait for better entries\n4. No clear risk/reward setups at current levels\n\n**Best opportunity:** \nBNB shows the most balanced technicals - RSI has cooled to neutral territory (54.6) after recent spike, price consolidating near EMA20, and MACD turning positive. This offers the best risk/reward as it's not chasing extreme overbought conditions.\n\n**Strategy:** \nEnter small BNB position with tight stop-loss. If wrong, loss is limited. If market continues higher, BNB should participate with less downside risk than overbought alternatives.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 6.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1165.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1110.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1110 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 40 indicating momentum failure\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 972.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

NO (target 1165.0)\n\n**Decision**: HOLD - Position is profitable, invalidation conditions not met, momentum remains positive. Price is consolidating near recent highs with strong RSI.

Price 114601 vs EMA20 111976 - extended move. No position, avoiding entry at these levels.\n\n**ETH**: RSI(7) 91.977 - Critically overbought. Price 4160.40 vs EMA20 3975.04 - massive extension. Too risky for new entry.\n\n**SOL**: RSI(7) 81.699 - Overbought but less extreme. Price 200.05 vs EMA20 194.69 - extended but manageable. However, with account down -13.41%, need to be selective.\n\n**XRP**: RSI(7) 70.165 - Cooling from extreme levels. Price 2.65 vs EMA20 2.56 - extended but showing consolidation.\n\n**DOGE**: RSI(7) 82.222 - Overbought. Price 0.2057 vs EMA20 0.1986 - extended move.\n\n**Risk Management Consideration**: \n- Account value: $8,659.50 (down 13.41%)\n- Available cash: $8,023.08\n- Current exposure: $6,828 in BNB (1 position)\n- Not adding new positions given overbought conditions across all coins and current drawdown\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 6.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1165.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1110.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1110 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 40 indicating momentum failure\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 972.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Given the strong momentum (MACD rising, price surging, high volume), there's a good probability of hitting this target soon. However, RSI(7) at 83.345 indicates extreme overbought conditions and potential exhaustion. The risk/reward here is tricky:\n- Upside to profit target: $13.60 per BNB = $81.60 total (vs current unrealized $147.82)\n- Downside if reversal: Could give back gains quickly\n\nGiven that:\n1. We're very close to profit target (1.18% away)\n2. RSI is extremely overbought (83.345)\n3. We already have solid unrealized gains (+$147.82)\n4. No invalidation conditions are met yet\n5. Momentum is still strong (MACD rising, volume high)\n\nI will **HOLD** to capture the profit target which appears achievable in the next few candles. The invalidation condition provides adequate protection if momentum fails.\n\n**Other coins (BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE):**\n- No existing positions\n- All showing extremely overbought conditions (RSI 7-period: BTC 92.76, ETH 94.04, SOL 90.92)\n- This late in a strong rally with such extreme RSI readings presents high reversal risk\n- Not entering new positions at these stretched levels\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 6.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1165.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1110.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1110 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 40 indicating momentum failure\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 972.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

ALL coins show signs of momentum exhaustion (RSI cooling from extreme levels)\n3. Most coins are pulling back from recent highs\n4. Market appears overextended after strong rally\n5. No clear low-risk entry points\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the poor portfolio performance (-12.38%) and extremely overbought conditions across the board, I should be highly selective. All coins show RSI cooling from extreme overbought levels (90+), suggesting the rally is exhausting. Entering positions now would be chasing momentum at dangerous levels.\n\n**Best Strategy:** Remain in cash and wait for better risk/reward setups. The market needs to digest these gains and provide clearer entry points with defined risk parameters.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{}\n```",

Price holding above EMA20 is bullish. However, recent peak at 115,566 suggests near-term resistance.\n- **Decision**: WAIT - Let price consolidate or pull back to EMA20 for better entry\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- **Price Action**: Strong rally from 3,931 to 4,174 (+6.2%)\n- **Technical**: Price well above EMA20 (4,174 vs 4,055), MACD positive (62.6), RSI at 69 (was 94 at peak)\n- **Volume**: 122,372 vs avg 56,121 - very strong volume\n- **Assessment**: Similar to BTC, strong move but cooling from overbought. Price above EMA20 is bullish. Good momentum but extended.\n- **Decision**: WAIT - Looking for pullback entry\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- **Price Action**: Rallied to 204.39, now at 200.10\n- **Technical**: Price above EMA20 (200.10 vs 197.08), MACD positive (2.4), RSI neutral at 50.7\n- **Volume**: 718,412 vs avg 469,004 - elevated\n- **Assessment**: Pulled back from 204.39 high, RSI reset to neutral zone. Price holding above EMA20. This is the most interesting setup - momentum intact but RSI reset provides entry opportunity.\n- **Decision**: BUY - Best risk/reward with RSI reset while maintaining uptrend\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- **Price Action**: Spiked to 1,180, crashed to 1,143.40 (-3.1% in one candle)\n- **Technical**: Price above EMA20 but sharp reversal, MACD weakening (8.95), RSI crashed from 93 to 45.7\n- **Assessment**: Major bearish reversal candle. Sharp drop suggests momentum break. Too risky.\n- **Decision**: AVOID - Bearish reversal pattern\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- **Price Action**: Consolidating around 2.63-2.66\n- **Technical**: Price above EMA20 (2.66 vs 2.59), MACD flat (0.044), RSI at 74.1\n- **Assessment**: Tight range, momentum slowing. Not enough edge.\n- **Decision**: AVOID - Choppy consolidation\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- **Price Action**: Rallied to 0.2068, pulling back to 0.2028\n- **Technical**: Price above EMA20 (0.2028 vs 0.2008), MACD positive (0.002), RSI at 45.3\n- **Assessment**: Similar to SOL - pullback after rally with RSI reset. However, smaller edge than SOL.\n- **Decision**: AVOID - SOL offers better setup\n\n## Trade Selection: SOL\nSOL presents the best risk/reward:\n1. Clear uptrend with price above EMA20\n2. RSI reset to neutral (50.7) after being overbought - healthy\n3. MACD still positive showing momentum intact\n4. Recent high at 204.39 provides clear resistance/target\n5. Volume elevated confirming interest\n\n**Entry**: 200.10\n**Profit Target**: 204.00 (near recent high, +1.95%)\n**Stop Loss**: 196.50 (below EMA20 and recent support)\n**Risk**: $3.60 per unit, targeting $3.90 gain = 1:1.08 R/R\n**Invalidation**: Close below 196.00 (breaks EMA20 support and uptrend structure)\n\nPosition sizing: Risk $400 (4.6% of capital)\nUnits: $400 / $3.60 = 111 SOL\nWith 15x leverage: 111 SOL * $200.10 = $22,211 notional / 15 = $1,481 margin required\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 111,\n      \"profit_target\": 204.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 196.50,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 196.00 on 3-minute candle, breaking EMA20 support and uptrend structure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price holding above EMA20 (198.63)\n2. Price well above invalidation level (196.00)\n3. MACD still positive (1.771)\n4. RSI neutral, no extreme oversold signal\n5. Stop-loss not threatened\n\nThe recent pullback from 204.39 to 199.69 is a normal retracement in an uptrend. The position structure remains intact with price above key support levels. The 15x leverage is manageable given the position is only down 0.20%.\n\n**DECISION: HOLD** - No exit conditions met, uptrend structure intact\n\n## Other Markets Review\n\n### BTC\n- Price: 114,350 above EMA20: 113,675.71\n- RSI: 50.928 (neutral)\n- MACD: 726.866 (strong positive)\n- Strong uptrend but no position to manage\n\n### ETH\n- Price: 4,111.80 above EMA20: 4,080.68\n- RSI: 41.936 (neutral-bearish)\n- MACD: 50.005 (positive)\n- Consolidating but no position\n\n### BNB\n- Price: 1,131.80 below EMA20: 1,133.99\n- RSI: 33.529 (oversold)\n- Showing weakness after spike to 1,180\n\n### XRP\n- Price: 2.64 above EMA20: 2.62\n- RSI: 52.955 (neutral)\n- Stable consolidation\n\n### DOGE\n- Price: 0.19965 below EMA20: 0.200736\n- RSI: 29.421 (oversold)\n- Showing weakness\n\n**Portfolio Risk Assessment:**\n- Current account value: $8,691.57\n- Cash available: $7,270.48\n- SOL position notional: $22,165.59 (2.55x account value at 15x leverage)\n- Current drawdown: -13.08%\n- Only one position open, concentrated risk\n\nGiven the portfolio is down 13% and we have significant cash available, I should maintain the SOL position as planned rather than taking a small loss. The technical setup remains valid.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 111.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 204.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 196.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 196.00 on 3-minute candle, breaking EMA20 support and uptrend structure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Bullish but no position.\n\n**ETH**: Weakening (4096, RSI 34.7 oversold, MACD declining). Price above EMA20 but losing momentum.\n\n**BNB**: Consolidating (1135, RSI 43, near EMA20). Neutral setup.\n\n**XRP**: Range-bound (2.64, RSI 45.9, slightly above EMA20). Sideways action.\n\n**DOGE**: Weak (0.1996, RSI 28.97 very oversold, below EMA20). Bearish.\n\n**Risk Management**: Currently down -14.02% with $7,270 cash available. The SOL position represents significant exposure ($22,078 notional). Given the negative performance, I should be cautious about adding new positions. Will focus on managing the existing SOL position properly.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 111.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 204.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 196.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 196.00 on 3-minute candle, breaking EMA20 support and uptrend structure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Account value is $8,202.03 with a -17.98% total return and negative Sharpe ratio of -8.802.

However, ALL major coins are showing extreme oversold conditions with RSI(7) readings below 25. This is a coordinated market-wide selloff.\n\n**The opportunity:** ETH and DOGE show the most extreme oversold conditions (RSI 11.565 and 7.266 respectively). These are bounce candidates, but given my negative track record, I should either:\n1. Stay in cash and wait for confirmation\n2. Take a small, highly selective position on the most oversold asset\n\n**Decision: I will take ONE small position on ETH** because:\n- RSI(7) at 11.565 is critically oversold (historically leads to bounces)\n- Clear support level visible around $3,950-$4,000\n- Risk/reward favorable for a counter-trend bounce trade\n- Will use tight stop-loss given my poor performance\n\nRisk management: Only risking ~$400 (5% of capital) on this mean-reversion trade.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 4150.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3920.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price breaks below $3,920 or if RSI(7) drops below 10 without bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.60,\n      \"risk_usd\": 580.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Strong downward momentum with RSI(7) at 23.917 (very oversold)\n2. Price broke below EMA(20) decisively\n3. MACD collapsing from 59.332 to 11.476 in 30 minutes\n4. Volume declining (45,198 vs avg 75,729) suggesting weak buying interest\n5.

However, the stop-loss at $3,920 is dangerously close\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- The market is showing extreme weakness across ALL coins (BTC RSI 16, SOL RSI 16.8, BNB RSI 15.9, DOGE RSI 6.5)\n- This suggests a broad market selloff\n- ETH has dropped $177 in the last 30 minutes\n- The stop-loss is only $76.90 away - very tight risk\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nWhile the invalidation condition (RSI < 10) has NOT been met, the technical picture is deteriorating rapidly:\n- Price below EMA(20) with declining MACD\n- Broad market weakness\n- Stop-loss very close at $3,920\n- Small profit of $16.91 at risk\n\nGiven the extreme market weakness and proximity to stop-loss, I will **HOLD** for now but monitor closely. The invalidation condition is specific and has not been triggered. However, if price approaches $3,920 or RSI continues declining toward 10, immediate exit would be warranted.\n\n**Other Coins Assessment:**\n- BTC: RSI(7) 16.0 - Extremely oversold but no position\n- SOL: RSI(7) 16.8 - Extremely oversold but no position  \n- BNB: RSI(7) 15.9 - Extremely oversold but no position\n- XRP: RSI(7) 29.1 - Oversold but holding better\n- DOGE: RSI(7) 6.5 - CRITICALLY oversold\n\nAll coins showing extreme weakness.

While RSI did drop below 10, it has bounced strongly back to 39.414, which is exactly what we wanted to see. The price is holding above the stop-loss at $3,920. However, the broader trend is concerning:\n- MACD momentum is declining rapidly (from 341 to 11)\n- Price remains below EMA20\n- Overall market showing weakness across all coins\n\nGiven the small profit and weak momentum, I should consider taking profits, but the invalidation condition technically hasn't been met yet. The RSI bounce from extreme oversold suggests potential for further recovery toward the $4,150 profit target.\n\n**HOLD DECISION:** The invalidation condition is not met (RSI bounced from <10 levels), price is above stop-loss, and we're in profit. Will maintain position but monitor closely.\n\n## Other Coins Analysis\n**BTC:** Price at $113,569, below EMA20 ($113,523.89), RSI 50.5 neutral. No strong setup.\n\n**SOL:** Price $195.67, below EMA20 ($197.29), RSI 40.8 oversold but no clear reversal. Weak.\n\n**BNB:** Price $1,116.60, below EMA20 ($1,127.40), RSI 44.2, MACD negative. Bearish.\n\n**XRP:** Price $2.63, at EMA20, RSI 57.6 neutral. Consolidating, no clear edge.\n\n**DOGE:** Price $0.194270, below EMA20 ($0.198173), RSI 28.4 oversold. Very weak momentum.\n\n**Conclusion:** No new positions warranted. Market showing broad weakness. Focus on managing existing ETH position.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 4150.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3920.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price breaks below $3,920 or if RSI(7) drops below 10 without bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 580.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price remains above the $3,920 stop-loss level and RSI(7) at 34.291 is far from the critical <10 level. While momentum is weakening, the position should be maintained as per the original exit plan. The stop-loss at $3,920 provides downside protection.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment:\n- **BTC**: Below EMA(20), RSI weak (41.262), MACD declining - No entry\n- **SOL**: Above EMA(20), RSI recovering (65.373), but small position size not worth risk\n- **BNB**: Below EMA(20), RSI weak (39.297), MACD negative - No entry\n- **XRP**: Consolidating, RSI improving (67.091) but flat MACD - No clear setup\n- **DOGE**: Below EMA(20), RSI weak (42.391), MACD negative - No entry\n\n**Portfolio Status**: Down -17.68%, Sharpe -8.802.

BTC down -1.8%, ETH down -3.5%, BNB down -3.4%, DOGE down -4.3%. This is a risk-off environment.\n\n## Position Review: ETH\n\n**Current Position Details**:\n- Entry: $3,978.00\n- Current: $3,949.50\n- Unrealized P&L: -$30.49 (-0.76%)\n- Stop-loss: $3,920.00\n- Profit target: $4,150.00\n- Invalidation: \"If price breaks below $3,920 or if RSI(7) drops below 10 without bounce\"\n\n**Technical Analysis**:\n- Current price: $3,949.50 is DANGEROUSLY CLOSE to stop-loss at $3,920.00 (only $29.50 buffer)\n- RSI(7): 19.701 - extremely oversold but NOT below 10 yet\n- RSI(14): 26.324 - deeply oversold\n- MACD: -22.625 - strongly negative and deteriorating\n- Price below EMA20 ($4,058.04) - bearish trend\n- Recent price action: Sharp selloff from $4,116 to $3,949 in last 30 minutes\n- Volume: 92,662 vs avg 86,259 - elevated selling pressure\n\n**Invalidation Check**:\nThe invalidation condition states: \"If price breaks below $3,920 or if RSI(7) drops below 10 without bounce\"\n\nCurrent status:\n- Price at $3,949.50 is $29.50 above the $3,920 stop-loss\n- RSI(7) at 19.701 is well above 10\n- However, the momentum is strongly bearish with accelerating downside\n\n**Decision Rationale**:\nThis is a critical moment. The position is:\n1. Very close to stop-loss ($29.50 away - less than 1%)\n2. In a strong downtrend (MACD -22.625 and falling)\n3. Below all key EMAs\n4. Market-wide selloff in progress\n\nWhile the invalidation condition is technically NOT met yet (price still above $3,920, RSI above 10), the risk/reward here is extremely poor. We're risking another $29.50 to stop-loss vs potential $200+ to profit target, but the momentum is entirely against us.\n\n**DECISION: CLOSE POSITION**\n- Reason: Risk management - too close to stop-loss with strong bearish momentum\n- Better to take a small -0.76% loss now than risk hitting the full stop-loss\n- The $29.50 buffer could evaporate in the next 3-minute candle given current volatility\n- Preserving capital is priority in this market environment\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC**: RSI(7) at 21.452 - oversold but in strong downtrend. MACD -273.783 showing severe bearish momentum. No position, not entering in this environment.\n\n**SOL**: RSI(7) at 47.842 - neutral. MACD slightly negative. Most stable coin but still below EMA. No compelling entry.\n\n**BNB**: RSI(7) at 24.728 - oversold. Strong selloff. No position, avoiding.\n\n**XRP**: RSI(7) at 45.002 - neutral. Most stable of all coins. Could be defensive play but not compelling enough.\n\n**DOGE**: RSI(7) at 20.293 - extremely oversold. Down -4.3%. High risk, avoiding.\n\n**Overall Strategy**: Close the ETH position to preserve capital. Sit in cash during this market-wide selloff. Wait for clear reversal signals before re-entering.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 4150.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3920.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price breaks below $3,920 or if RSI(7) drops below 10 without bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 580.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - price within $29.50 of stop-loss with strong bearish momentum (MACD -22.625, RSI 19.7).

The price touched $192.75 but did not close below $192.00. Current RSI shows recovery from oversold levels (was 27.942, now 49.769), suggesting potential bounce. However, the position is:\n1. Below entry price by 0.66%\n2. Below EMA20 (bearish structure)\n3. MACD still negative\n4. Close to stop-loss ($192.50 is only $3.37 away)\n\nGiven the proximity to stop-loss and the bearish technical setup (below EMA20, negative MACD), combined with already being in a losing position with 15x leverage, the prudent risk management decision is to **CLOSE** this position. The invalidation level of $192.00 is dangerously close, and further downside could trigger the stop-loss anyway.\n\n**Other Coins Assessment:**\n- **BTC**: Oversold (RSI 47.4), but below EMA20 and negative MACD. Downtrend from $113,694 to $111,430. Not entering.\n- **ETH**: Very oversold (RSI 39.9), below EMA20, negative MACD. Weak momentum. Not entering.\n- **BNB**: RSI recovering to 61.7, but still below EMA20. Showing relative strength but insufficient confirmation. Not entering.\n- **XRP**: Below EMA20, negative MACD, RSI 42.3. Weak setup. Not entering.\n- **DOGE**: Very weak, RSI 40.2, below EMA20, negative MACD. Not entering.\n\n**Portfolio Status:**\n- Current account value: $8,133.77 (down 18.66%)\n- Available cash: $8,015.43\n- Only 1 position open (SOL) with small loss\n\nGiven the overall market weakness (all coins below their EMA20s, negative MACDs), and the proximity of SOL to its stop-loss, I will close the SOL position to preserve capital and avoid further losses.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 10.15,\n      \"profit_target\": 205.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 192.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $192.00 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 300.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - price dangerously close to stop-loss ($192.50) with only $3.37 cushion.

Portfolio is down -18.66% with a negative Sharpe ratio of -8.512, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. I need to be highly selective and only enter trades with strong conviction.\n\n## Market Overview - All Coins Showing Weakness\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $109,784 vs EMA20: $112,641 (2.5% below)\n- RSI(7): 26.9 (oversold), RSI(14): 27.4 (oversold)\n- MACD: -1,247.86 (strongly negative and worsening)\n- Price action: Down from $113,569 to $109,784 in last 30 minutes (-3.3%)\n- Below both 20-period and 50-period EMAs (bearish structure)\n- Assessment: Oversold but in strong downtrend. Could bounce, but no clear reversal signal yet.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,880.70 vs EMA20: $4,017.79 (3.4% below)\n- RSI(7): 21.8 (deeply oversold), RSI(14): 22.9 (deeply oversold)\n- MACD: -72.49 (strongly negative and worsening)\n- Price dropped from $4,022 to $3,880 (-3.5% in 30 minutes)\n- Below both EMAs, weak momentum\n- Assessment: Most oversold of major coins, but downtrend intact.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $191.88 vs EMA20: $197.06 (2.6% below)\n- RSI(7): 30.7 (approaching oversold), RSI(14): 34.9\n- MACD: -1.95 (negative but least severe)\n- Relative strength: Holding better than BTC/ETH\n- Assessment: Weakening but showing relative strength vs peers.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,111.20 vs EMA20: $1,123.48 (1.1% below)\n- RSI(7): 44.3 (neutral), RSI(14): 41.6 (neutral)\n- MACD: -10.94 (negative but improving from -13.24)\n- Recent bounce from $1,098 to $1,118\n- Assessment: Showing best relative strength, RSI not oversold.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.54 vs EMA20: $2.61 (2.7% below)\n- RSI(7): 26.5 (oversold), RSI(14): 30.7 (oversold)\n- MACD: -0.017 (negative and worsening)\n- Dropped from $2.65 to $2.54 (-4.2%)\n- Assessment: Oversold and weak.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.18784 vs EMA20: $0.19612 (4.2% below)\n- RSI(7): 21.2 (deeply oversold), RSI(14): 24.8 (deeply oversold)\n- MACD: -0.004 (negative)\n- Dropped from $0.1953 to $0.1878 (-3.8%)\n- Assessment: Very weak, deeply oversold.\n\n## Trading Decision\n\nGiven the current market conditions:\n- ALL coins are in downtrends (below EMA20)\n- Multiple coins showing oversold RSI readings\n- No clear reversal signals (MACD still negative, no bullish divergence)\n- Volume is below average across most coins\n- My portfolio is already down -18.66% - need to preserve capital\n\n**Risk Assessment:** While oversold conditions often precede bounces, there are no clear reversal signals. The market could continue lower or consolidate. Given my negative performance, I should wait for clearer entry signals rather than trying to catch a falling knife.\n\n**Best Opportunity:** If I were to enter, BNB shows the most relative strength with neutral RSI (44.3) and improving MACD momentum. However, it's still below EMA and in a downtrend.\n\n**Decision:** STAND ASIDE. No trades. Wait for clearer reversal signals such as:\n- Price reclaiming EMA20\n- Bullish MACD crossover\n- RSI divergence\n- Clear higher lows forming\n\nThe risk of entering now outweighs potential reward. Better to preserve capital and wait for confirmation of trend reversal.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

This represents extreme oversold conditions that historically lead to sharp bounces.\n\n**Strategy:** With RSI levels this extreme (especially ETH at 10.285 and DOGE at 10.696), we're likely near a short-term bottom. However, given:\n1. My negative performance (-18.66%)\n2. Strong downtrend momentum (all MACD deeply negative)\n3. No clear reversal signals yet (prices still declining)\n4. High risk of further capitulation\n\n**Decision:** WAIT for reversal confirmation. While oversold conditions suggest a bounce is imminent, catching a falling knife in a leveraged account with already negative performance is too risky. I need to see:\n- RSI starting to turn up\n- Price stabilization or higher lows\n- MACD beginning to flatten or turn positive\n- Reduced selling volume\n\nGiven the extreme conditions, if I were to enter, ETH and DOGE show the most extreme oversold readings, but the momentum is still strongly negative. Better to preserve capital and wait for confirmation of a reversal.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

However, given my poor performance (-18.66%), I need to be selective and use tight risk management.\n\n**Best Opportunity**: ETH shows the most extreme oversold condition (RSI 6.60) with the largest percentage drop (-8.3%).
