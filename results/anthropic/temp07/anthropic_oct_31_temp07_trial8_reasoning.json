I need to analyze the market conditions for all coins and identify potential entry opportunities.\n\n## Market Analysis by Coin:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current price: $109,160 (down from $110,800 start of period)\n- Price well below EMA20 ($111,104.55), indicating downtrend\n- MACD: -1,429.36 (deeply negative, but improving from -1,438.86)\n- RSI(7): 43.86 (recovering from oversold 20.83, but still neutral)\n- RSI(14): 37.40 (below 40, bearish territory)\n- Recent action: Sharp drop to $108,211, now recovering\n- Volume: 3,548 vs avg 7,856 (LOW - only 45% of average)\n- Assessment: In downtrend but showing signs of stabilization. Low volume concerning. Wait for confirmation.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current price: $3,930.90 (down from $3,979.60)\n- Price below EMA20 ($4,023.44), downtrend\n- MACD: -71.78 (negative but improving slightly from -72.73)\n- RSI(7): 45.55 (recovering from 21.37 oversold)\n- RSI(14): 39.96 (approaching neutral from 26.64)\n- Recent action: Sharp drop to $3,864.90, now recovering\n- Volume: 52,185 vs avg 135,854 (LOW - only 38% of average)\n- Assessment: Similar pattern to BTC. Oversold bounce but weak volume. Not convinced yet.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current price: $186.91 (down from $197.00, -5.1%)\n- Price well below EMA20 ($195.30), clear downtrend\n- MACD: -5.06 (worsening from -2.16)\n- RSI(7): 35.56 (recovering from 19.01 extreme oversold)\n- RSI(14): 32.65 (still in bearish territory)\n- Recent action: Dropped from $196.80 to $184.76, modest recovery\n- Volume: 464,415 vs avg 1,197,512 (LOW - only 39% of average)\n- Assessment: Weak. Still in downtrend with poor volume.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current price: $1,149.30 (down from $1,168.20)\n- Price significantly below EMA20 ($1,188.16)\n- MACD: -31.54 (negative, slight improvement)\n- RSI(7): 37.76 (recovering from 13.52 extreme oversold)\n- RSI(14): 32.62 (bearish)\n- Recent action: Sharp drop to $1,134.80, slight recovery\n- Volume: 4,336 vs avg 19,294 (VERY LOW - only 22% of average)\n- Assessment: Weakest volume of all. Avoid.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current price: $2.36 (down from $2.43, -2.9%)\n- Price below EMA20 ($2.44)\n- MACD: -0.058 (stable negative)\n- RSI(7): 41.48 (recovering from 20.24 oversold)\n- RSI(14): 35.06 (bearish but improving)\n- Recent action: Drop to $2.33, recovering\n- Volume: 13,076,200 vs avg 10,321,691 (ABOVE AVERAGE +27%)\n- Assessment: **INTERESTING** - Only coin with above-average volume, showing recovery from oversold.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current price: $0.190230 (down from $0.198440, -4.1%)\n- Price below EMA20 ($0.198261)\n- MACD: -0.005 (negative, worsening)\n- RSI(7): 37.34 (recovering from 18.50 oversold)\n- RSI(14): 32.67 (bearish)\n- Recent action: Spike to $0.200260, then dropped to $0.187720\n- Volume: 16,194,734 vs avg 67,545,595 (LOW - only 24% of average)\n- Assessment: Weak volume, volatile. Avoid.\n\n## Trading Decision:\n\nAll markets are in downtrends with most showing very weak volume (concerning). However, I see a potential opportunity in **XRP**:\n\n1. **Only coin with above-average volume** (+27%) - suggests real interest/conviction\n2. RSI recovering from deeply oversold levels (20.24 \u2192 41.48)\n3. Price stabilizing around $2.36 after testing $2.33 support\n4. Smaller drawdown (-2.9%) compared to others\n5. Volume spike suggests potential reversal interest\n\nI will take a SMALL position in XRP with tight risk management, using only 20% of capital ($2,000 risk) at 15x leverage to test the waters. This is a mean-reversion play on oversold bounce with volume confirmation.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 12711,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.48,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.31,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.31 on 3-minute candle (below recent low) or if RSI(7) drops back below 30 indicating failed bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 2000\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

This is my second invocation, just starting trading operations.\n\n### Market-Wide Technical Assessment:\n\n**BTC (105589):**\n- RSI(7): 17.83 - EXTREMELY oversold (below 20)\n- RSI(14): 22.30 - Deeply oversold\n- Price: 4.3% below EMA20 (110350)\n- MACD: -1386.48 - Strong bearish momentum\n- Recent price action: Sharp drop from 111268 to 105589 (-5.1%)\n- This is a capitulation-level oversold condition\n\n**ETH (3756.40):**\n- RSI(7): 20.61 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 25.49 - Deeply oversold  \n- Price: 5.8% below EMA20 (3986.21)\n- MACD: -68.51 - Strong bearish momentum\n- Recent drop: 3979 to 3756 (-5.6%)\n\n**SOL (177.65):**\n- RSI(7): 16.37 - MOST oversold of all\n- RSI(14): 21.48 - Deeply oversold\n- Price: 8.1% below EMA20 (193.22)\n- Recent drop: 194.58 to 177.65 (-8.7%)\n- Severe capitulation\n\n**BNB (1062.60):**\n- RSI(7): 9.55 - CATASTROPHICALLY oversold (extreme)\n- RSI(14): 14.74 - Extreme oversold\n- Price: 9.5% below EMA20 (1174.19)\n- Recent drop: 1163.70 to 1062.60 (-8.7%)\n- This is panic selling territory\n\n**XRP (2.24):**\n- RSI(7): 17.43 - Extremely oversold\n- RSI(14): 21.14 - Deeply oversold\n- Price: 7.1% below EMA20 (2.41)\n\n**DOGE (0.17849):**\n- RSI(7): 14.76 - Extremely oversold\n- RSI(14): 19.16 - Extreme oversold\n- Price: 8.7% below EMA20 (0.195551)\n\n## Trading Strategy\n\nThis is a classic mean-reversion setup. ALL coins are showing extreme oversold conditions with RSI(7) below 25 and most below 20. The market appears to be in capitulation mode. Historical data shows these extreme RSI levels typically precede short-term bounces.\n\n**Risk Management Approach:**\n- Total capital: $8,422.86\n- Will deploy ~60% of capital across 3 positions\n- Risk $500-700 per position\n- Use 15x leverage for optimal risk/reward\n- Set tight stop-losses 3-5% below entry\n- Target 5-8% bounce for profit targets\n\n**Position Selection:**\n1. **BNB** - RSI(7) at 9.55 is historically extreme, highest probability bounce\n2. **SOL** - RSI(7) at 16.37, strong altcoin with good liquidity\n3. **BTC** - RSI(7) at 17.83, market leader, most liquid\n\nI'm avoiding ETH, XRP, and DOGE to maintain diversification limits and focus on the most extreme setups.\n\n## Position Sizing Calculations:\n\n**BNB:** \n- Entry: 1062.60\n- Stop-loss: 1020 (-4.0%)\n- Profit target: 1140 (+7.3%)\n- Risk per unit: $42.60\n- Position size: $2,500 / 15x = 2.35 BNB notional\n- Risk: ~$100 real / $667 notional\n\n**SOL:**\n- Entry: 177.65\n- Stop-loss: 170 (-4.3%)\n- Profit target: 191 (+7.5%)\n- Risk per unit: $7.65\n- Position size: $2,500 / 15x = 14.07 SOL notional\n- Risk: ~$107 real / $675 notional\n\n**BTC:**\n- Entry: 105589\n- Stop-loss: 101500 (-3.9%)\n- Profit target: 113000 (+7.0%)\n- Risk per unit: $4089\n- Position size: $2,500 / 15x = 0.0237 BTC notional\n- Risk: ~$97 real / $642 notional\n\nTotal deployment: ~$7,500 (89% of capital)\nTotal risk: ~$304 real capital (3.6% of account)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.35,\n      \"profit_target\": 1140.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1020.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1020 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 8\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.82,\n      \"risk_usd\": 667.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 14.07,\n      \"profit_target\": 191.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 170 on 3-minute candle or fails to bounce within 30 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 675.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.0237,\n      \"profit_target\": 113000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 101500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 101500 on 3-minute candle or breaks recent low of 105000\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 642.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The invalidation condition is NOT technically met (price above 1,020, RSI above 8), but this is the weakest position with highest downside risk. The recent candle showed a -7.8% drop which is alarming.\n- **Decision:** HOLD for now as invalidation not met, but this is on thin ice.\n\n**SOL Position:**\n- Entry: 177.65, Current: 181.47 (+2.15%, +$52.50 PnL)\n- Stop-loss: 170, Profit target: 191\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below 170 on 3-minute candle or fails to bounce within 30 minutes\"\n- Current price: 181.47 (well above 170 stop-loss)\n- **Analysis:** Best performing position with decent profit. Price bounced from 177.65 low and is showing some recovery (+2.15% from entry). RSI(7) at 35.6 shows oversold but not extreme. The \"30 minute bounce\" condition is subjective - we entered at the low and price has bounced 2.2%, so technically bouncing.\n- **Decision:** HOLD - invalidation not met, position in profit, showing relative strength.\n\n**BTC Position:**\n- Entry: 105,589, Current: 105,671 (+0.08%, +$0.69 PnL)\n- Stop-loss: 101,500, Profit target: 113,000\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below 101500 on 3-minute candle or breaks recent low of 105000\"\n- Current price: 105,671 (above both 101,500 and 105,000)\n- **Analysis:** Essentially flat position. BTC showing extreme weakness with RSI(7) at 19.3. Price is precariously close to the invalidation level of 105,000 (only 671 points above). The latest candle went from 105,589 to 105,671, barely holding. This is high risk.\n- **Decision:** HOLD for now as invalidation not met, but monitoring closely.\n\n**Risk Management:**\n- Total account value: $8,497.58 (down 15% from start)\n- Open positions total notional: ~$7,576\n- All three positions are at high risk given market conditions\n- No new positions should be opened in this extreme selloff\n\n**Other Coins (No Positions):**\n- ETH, XRP, DOGE: All showing severe weakness, no reason to enter new trades in this environment\n\nAll positions remain technically valid (invalidation conditions not met), so I will HOLD all three but acknowledge the high risk environment.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.35,\n      \"profit_target\": 1140.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1020.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1020 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 8\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.82,\n      \"risk_usd\": 667.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 14.07,\n      \"profit_target\": 191.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 170 on 3-minute candle or fails to bounce within 30 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 675.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.0237,\n      \"profit_target\": 113000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 101500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 101500 on 3-minute candle or breaks recent low of 105000\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 642.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

RSI extremely oversold at 20.752 (14-period at 22.678). MACD deeply negative at -22.672. Price well below EMA20 (1142.29).\n- **Assessment**: Invalidation NOT met - price hasn't closed below 1020 and RSI(7) is 20.752 (above 8 threshold). However, this is in severe downtrend with massive selling pressure. The position is barely profitable (+1%) and market structure is deteriorating rapidly.\n- **Decision**: **HOLD** - Invalidation condition not triggered yet.

RSI recovering (41.565 from previous 35.612). MACD negative at -3.878 but improving. Price below EMA20 (189.96) but showing bounce attempt.\n- **Assessment**: Invalidation NOT met - price well above 170 and showing bounce recovery. Position up 2.86%. RSI improving from oversold levels suggests potential continuation.\n- **Decision**: **HOLD** - Position showing strength with decent profit cushion. Invalidation not triggered.\n\n## BTC Position Analysis\n- **Entry**: 105589.0, **Current**: 106821.0 (+1.17%)\n- **Unrealized PnL**: +$27.95\n- **Stop-loss**: 101500.0, **Profit target**: 113000.0\n- **Invalidation condition**: \"If price closes below 101500 on 3-minute candle or breaks recent low of 105000\"\n- **Current RSI(7)**: 39.583 (oversold territory)\n- **Technical state**: Price 5321 points above stop-loss but 1821 points above invalidation level (105000). RSI oversold at 39.583. MACD deeply negative at -1257.721. Price well below EMA20 (109340.94).\n- **Assessment**: Invalidation NOT met - price hasn't closed below 101500 or broken 105000. However, we saw a low of 105589 (entry price) and 105671 in recent candles, very close to the 105000 invalidation level. This is concerning as we're hovering near invalidation.\n- **Decision**: **HOLD** - Technically invalidation not met, but this is on thin ice. Price action is weak and approaching danger zone.\n\n## Risk Management Overview\n- **Total account value**: $8,551.47 (down -14.49%)\n- **Total unrealized PnL**: +$123.85 across all positions\n- **Portfolio exposure**: All three positions are barely profitable and in downtrending markets\n- **Market context**: Severe selling pressure across all major cryptos. BTC down from 111288 to 106821, ETH down from 4012 to 3797, SOL down from 193 to 182, BNB crashed from 1183 to 1074.\n\nAll positions are technically valid (invalidation conditions not met) but markets are in clear downtrends with deeply negative MACD, prices below EMAs, and weak RSI readings. I'll hold positions as invalidation conditions have not been triggered, but this is a precarious situation requiring close monitoring.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.35,\n      \"profit_target\": 1140.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1020.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1020 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 8\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.82,\n      \"risk_usd\": 667.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 14.07,\n      \"profit_target\": 191.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 170 on 3-minute candle or fails to bounce within 30 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 675.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.0237,\n      \"profit_target\": 113000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 101500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 101500 on 3-minute candle or breaks recent low of 105000\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 642.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "# CHAIN OF THOUGHT\n\nReviewing each of my 3 open positions against their invalidation conditions and technical indicators:\n\n**BNB Position Analysis:**\n- Entry: 1062.6, Current: 1066.1 (+0.33%, +$6.98 unrealized PnL)\n- Stop-loss: 1020.0, Profit target: 1140.0\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below 1020 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 8\"\n- Current RSI(7): 17.929 (well above 8 threshold)\n- Current price: 1066.1 (well above 1020 stop-loss)\n- Technical concerns: RSI(7) at 17.929 is extremely oversold, MACD deeply negative at -33.538, price below EMA20 (1140.88), strong downtrend\n- **CRITICAL ISSUE**: While invalidation conditions are NOT technically met, the position shows severe weakness. Price dropped from 1183.80 to 1062.60 entry, then to current 1066.10. The RSI(7) at 17.929 indicates extreme oversold conditions but hasn't bounced meaningfully. The market structure is deteriorating rapidly.\n- **Decision: CLOSE POSITION** - Risk management override. While invalidation not technically triggered, the extreme weakness (RSI 17.929, MACD -33.538, price 6.5% below EMA20) suggests high probability of hitting stop-loss at 1020. Better to exit now with small profit than risk -$100 loss.\n\n**SOL Position Analysis:**\n- Entry: 177.65, Current: 181.93 (+2.41%, +$58.97 unrealized PnL)\n- Stop-loss: 170.0, Profit target: 191.0\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below 170 on 3-minute candle or fails to bounce within 30 minutes\"\n- Current price: 181.93 (well above 170 stop-loss, 11.93 points of cushion)\n- Technical status: RSI(7) at 38.373 (recovering from oversold), MACD -5.249 (negative but stabilizing), price below EMA20 (190.13) but holding above 180\n- Price action: Bottomed at 177.65, recovered to 181.93. Showing resilience.\n- **Decision: HOLD** - Invalidation NOT met. Position has breathing room with 11.93 points to stop-loss. Recent price action shows stabilization after bounce from 177.65. Risk/reward remains favorable toward 191.0 target.\n\n**BTC Position Analysis:**\n- Entry: 105589.0, Current: 106421.0 (+0.79%, +$18.47 unrealized PnL)\n- Stop-loss: 101500.0, Profit target: 113000.0\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below 101500 on 3-minute candle or breaks recent low of 105000\"\n- Current price: 106421.0 (above both 101500 stop and 105000 invalidation level)\n- Technical status: RSI(7) at 35.342 (oversold territory), MACD -1612.041 (deeply negative), price below EMA20 (109277.27)\n- Price action: Dropped from 110526 to 105589 entry, recovered slightly to 106421. Still in downtrend.\n- **CONCERN**: Price is only 1421 points above the 105000 invalidation level. If next candle breaks 105000, invalidation triggers.\n- **Decision: HOLD** - Invalidation NOT met yet. Price remains above 105000 critical level. However, this position is on thin ice and requires close monitoring.\n\n**Risk Management Assessment:**\n- Current account value: $8,509.40 (down -14.91%)\n- Open positions total notional: ~$7,587\n- All three positions are in downtrending markets with negative MACD and prices below EMA20\n- BNB showing extreme weakness warrants exit for risk management\n- SOL and BTC have invalidation conditions not yet triggered, so holding per rules\n\n**No New Positions:**\n- ETH, XRP, DOGE all showing similar bearish technical patterns (negative MACD, RSI in 30-40 range, prices below EMA20)\n- Market-wide correction in progress\n- Not appropriate to add new leveraged positions in this environment\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.35,\n      \"profit_target\": 1140.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1020.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1020 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 8\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.82,\n      \"risk_usd\": 667.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - extreme technical weakness with RSI(7) at 17.929, MACD at -33.538, and price 6.5% below EMA20.

RSI is overbought at 71.21, suggesting potential exhaustion. Given we're up 5.5% and near target, I should **CLOSE POSITION** to lock in profits.

Price is recovering but still below EMA20. Far from profit target (113000). RSI healthy at 55. **HOLD** - give it room to reach target.\n\n## Other Coins (ETH, BNB, XRP, DOGE)\n- **ETH**: RSI 61, MACD improving, price near EMA20. Neutral setup but no strong entry signal.\n- **BNB**: RSI 44.7, price well below EMA20 (1092 vs 1112.86), still in downtrend. Not attractive.\n- **XRP**: RSI 57.3, price slightly above EMA20, MACD improving. Neutral but no compelling setup.\n- **DOGE**: RSI 72.7 - OVERBOUGHT, similar to SOL. Price near EMA20. Would be chasing at these levels.\n\n**Portfolio Risk**: Currently have 2 positions with combined notional ~$5177. Account value $8609. Not overleveraged.

The MACD is improving (becoming less negative), suggesting weakening bearish momentum. RSI is neutral, not showing extremes. Price is consolidating after a recovery bounce. The invalidation condition has not been triggered - we're $2,215 above the critical $105k level. \n\nHowever, I'm concerned about:\n1. Price below EMA20 ($107,798) - indicates short-term weakness\n2. MACD still negative (though improving)\n3. Longer-term context shows 20 EMA below 50 EMA (bearish structure)\n4. Small profit of only $37 on a leveraged position\n\nGiven that we're only 7 minutes into trading and the position is slightly profitable but showing technical weakness, I'll **HOLD** for now but monitor closely. The invalidation condition is clear and has not been met.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**ETH:** Strong momentum with RSI(7) at 71.158, price above EMA20, MACD improving. Showing relative strength vs BTC. Potential buy candidate but no pyramiding allowed.\n\n**SOL:** Price at $186.90 near EMA20 ($186.78), RSI(7) at 62.6, MACD improving. Neutral setup.\n\n**BNB:** Weak - price $1,091 well below EMA20 ($1,110), RSI(7) only 43.76, still in downtrend. Avoid.\n\n**XRP:** Recovering nicely, RSI(7) at 62.8, price above EMA20, MACD improving. Potential but conservative given current drawdown.\n\n**DOGE:** Very strong RSI(7) at 79.48 (overbought), price above EMA20, MACD turning positive. Momentum play but risky at these levels.\n\n**Portfolio Decision:** With -14% drawdown and limited capital, I'll maintain the BTC position as invalidation has not been met.

The sharp price drop in the latest candle (from 107,215 to 106,726) shows renewed selling pressure\n2. RSI(7) plummeted from 58.43 to 36.17 - significant bearish momentum\n3. Price is trending below EMA20 consistently\n4. MACD remains deeply negative despite slight improvement\n5. The invalidation condition states \"breaks recent low of 105000\" - we're currently at $106,726, only $1,726 above this critical level\n6. Given the sharp drop and oversold conditions, there's risk of further downside momentum\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Position is only +1.08% in profit ($25.70)\n- 15x leverage means high risk exposure\n- Volatility increasing (sharp moves in recent candles)\n- If price continues down another ~1.6%, we hit the invalidation level\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe invalidation condition has NOT been technically met yet (price hasn't closed below $105,000), but we're seeing:\n- Renewed bearish pressure (sharp drop + RSI collapse)\n- Minimal profit cushion ($25.70)\n- High leverage risk (15x)\n- Proximity to invalidation level ($1,726 buffer)\n\nHowever, the oversold RSI conditions (36.17 on 7-period, 38.63 on 14-period) could suggest a bounce is possible. The MACD is also improving slightly.\n\n**Conservative approach:** Given the sharp momentum shift, minimal profits, and proximity to invalidation, I should consider taking the small profit and waiting for clearer signals. The risk/reward is unfavorable here.\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION** - Taking profits due to renewed bearish momentum, minimal profit cushion, and risk management. Better to preserve capital and wait for clearer setup.\n\n## Other Coins Analysis:\n- **ETH**: Neutral signals, no position - not entering\n- **SOL**: Neutral/weak signals, no position - not entering  \n- **BNB**: Weak/bearish, no position - not entering\n- **XRP**: Consolidating, no position - not entering\n- **DOGE**: Neutral, no position - not entering\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.0237,\n      \"profit_target\": 113000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 101500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 101500 on 3-minute candle or breaks recent low of 105000\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 642.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - sharp bearish momentum shift with RSI(7) collapsing from 58.43 to 36.17, price dropping $489 in last candle, only $1,726 above invalidation level with minimal profit cushion of $25.70.

Will take smaller position.\n\n## Trading Decision Rationale\n\nGiven my -14.15% drawdown, I need high-probability setups with clear risk management. \n\n**ETH** shows the best setup:\n- Technical breakout above EMA20\n- Strong volume confirmation\n- MACD turning positive\n- RSI overbought but not extreme (71.7)\n- Risk: $600 (7% of account)\n- Entry: $3,922.20\n- Stop-loss: $3,840 (2.1% below entry, below recent support at $3,830)\n- Profit target: $4,050 (3.3% gain, near psychological resistance)\n- Leverage: 15x for better capital efficiency\n\n**DOGE** also shows strong momentum:\n- Explosive move with RSI 77.4\n- Breaking above consolidation\n- Risk: $400 (4.7% of account)\n- Entry: $0.193210\n- Stop-loss: $0.1870 (3.2% below entry, below recent support)\n- Profit target: $0.2000 (3.5% gain, psychological level)\n- Leverage: 12x (lower due to higher volatility)\n\nTotal risk exposure: ~$1,000 (11.7% of account) - acceptable for two high-probability setups.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.3,\n      \"profit_target\": 4050.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3840.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,830 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 45\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 600.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 24800,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.2000,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.1870,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $0.1870 on 3-minute candle or MACD crosses below -0.003\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

While the invalidation condition says \"RSI(7) drops below 45\" (not met), such extreme overbought readings typically precede sharp reversals. However, price is above $3,830 and trending toward profit target. The position is profitable but vulnerable.\n\n**Decision for ETH:** HOLD - Invalidation condition NOT met (price above $3,830, RSI above 45). Approaching profit target at $4,050. Will let it run toward target despite overbought RSI.\n\n**DOGE Position Analysis:**\n- Entry: $0.19321, Current: $0.19644 (+$0.00323/coin, +1.67%)\n- Unrealized PnL: +$77.71 (+1.63% of position)\n- Profit target: $0.20 (only $0.00356 away - VERY CLOSE)\n- Stop-loss: $0.187 (safe, $0.00944 cushion)\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below $0.1870 on 3-minute candle or MACD crosses below -0.003\"\n- Current MACD: -0.001 (above -0.003 threshold, improving)\n- RSI(7): 85.112 (EXTREMELY overbought - highest of all coins)\n- Price action: Strong momentum but at extreme overbought levels\n\n**Critical concern for DOGE:** RSI(7) at 85.11 is the most overbought reading in the portfolio. Price is only $0.00356 from profit target ($0.20). MACD at -0.001 is well above the invalidation level of -0.003.\n\n**Decision for DOGE:** HOLD - Invalidation NOT met (price above $0.1870, MACD above -0.003). Very close to profit target. Let it hit the target.\n\n**Other Coins (BTC, SOL, BNB, XRP):**\n- BTC: RSI(7) 78.90, MACD improving, strong momentum but no position\n- SOL: RSI(7) 79.76, similar overbought conditions\n- BNB: RSI(7) 73.31, momentum building\n- XRP: RSI(7) 74.17, steady uptrend\n\nAll show overbought conditions on short-term RSI but I have no positions.

However, RSI(7) at 86.2 is dangerously overbought, suggesting imminent pullback risk. Given we're only 1.67% from profit target vs 3.6% from stop loss, the risk/reward is unfavorable for continued holding. The extreme RSI reading suggests taking profits is prudent before a reversal. **CLOSE and take profits.**\n\n## DOGE Position Analysis\n- Entry: $0.19321, Current: $0.19669 (+$0.00348/coin, +1.80%)\n- Unrealized PnL: +$83.91 (+1.72% of notional)\n- Profit Target: $0.20 ($0.00331 away, 1.68% upside)\n- Stop Loss: $0.187 ($0.00969 cushion)\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below $0.1870 on 3-minute candle or MACD crosses below -0.003\"\n\n**Technical Assessment:**\n- RSI(7): 86.160 - EXTREMELY overbought (similar to ETH)\n- RSI(14): 77.249 - Very overbought\n- MACD: +0.002 (positive but small)\n- Price vs EMA20: $0.19669 vs $0.18986 (+3.60% above)\n- Recent momentum: Strong rally from $0.18769 to $0.19669\n\n**Invalidation Check:**\n- Price is NOT below $0.1870 (currently $0.19669) \u2713\n- MACD is NOT below -0.003 (currently +0.002) \u2713\n- Invalidation condition NOT met\n\n**Decision Rationale:** Similar to ETH, DOGE is showing extreme overbought conditions with RSI(7) at 86.16. We're very close to profit target ($0.00331 away = 1.68%). The parabolic move and extreme RSI suggest this is an optimal exit point before mean reversion. **CLOSE and take profits.**\n\n## Other Coins (BTC, SOL, BNB, XRP)\nNo positions held. Reviewing opportunities:\n\n**BTC:** RSI(7) 83.608 - extremely overbought, MACD turning positive but price extended. Too late to enter.\n\n**SOL:** RSI(7) 58.473 - neutral, MACD +0.664 positive but modest. Price consolidating around $188-190. Not compelling.\n\n**BNB:** RSI(7) 69.423 - approaching overbought, MACD still negative (-5.194). Mixed signals, pass.\n\n**XRP:** RSI(7) 72.100 - overbought, MACD +0.012 barely positive. Price at $2.40 vs EMA $2.35. Extended, pass.\n\n**Conclusion:** All major coins showing overbought conditions. Better to take profits on existing positions and wait for pullbacks before re-entering.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.3,\n      \"profit_target\": 4050.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3840.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,830 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 45\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 600.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Taking profits - RSI(7) at extreme overbought level of 86.2, only 1.67% from profit target, risk of imminent pullback high\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 24800.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.2,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.187,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $0.1870 on 3-minute candle or MACD crosses below -0.003\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Taking profits - RSI(7) at extreme overbought level of 86.16, only 1.68% from profit target, parabolic move suggests mean reversion imminent\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Current price is $0.199060, which is significantly above $0.1880 (5.9% above). The invalidation condition has NOT been met.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Stop-loss at $0.188 would result in approximately -$214 loss\n- Current unrealized gain: +$110.77\n- Profit target at $0.205 would yield approximately +$290 gain\n- RSI extremely overbought suggests potential for pullback or consolidation\n- However, MACD still positive and price above EMA20 shows continued momentum\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nWhile RSI is extremely overbought (81.814 on 7-period), the invalidation condition has not been met. The price remains well above the $0.1880 invalidation level. The position is profitable and showing momentum. However, given the extreme overbought conditions, I need to be cautious. The invalidation condition is clear and has not been triggered, so per trading rules, I should HOLD unless the invalidation is met or stop-loss/profit target is hit.\n\nCurrent price ($0.199060) is:\n- Above stop-loss ($0.188) \u2713\n- Below profit target ($0.205) - only $0.006 away (2.9%)\n- Well above invalidation ($0.1880) \u2713\n\n**Final Decision: HOLD** - The invalidation condition has not been met, stop-loss not hit, and profit target not reached yet. Despite overbought conditions, the trend remains intact and the position is profitable. Will maintain position with existing exit plan.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP: No positions, not entering new trades given current overbought market conditions across the board and portfolio already exposed.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 30000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.205,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.188,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.1880 (below recent consolidation low) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 585.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The invalidation condition (below 0.1880) has NOT been met - current price is 0.201150\n2. RSI at 86.119 indicates extreme overbought conditions - high risk of pullback\n3. Price is approaching profit target (0.205) - only 1.9% away\n4. Position is profitable (+$173) but at risk of reversal given RSI levels\n5. Recent candle shows slight weakness (0.199060 \u2192 0.201150, smaller gain)\n\n**Risk Management Decision:**\nGiven the extreme RSI readings (86-87 range), the position is at high risk of a sharp reversal. While the invalidation condition hasn't been met, the technical setup suggests taking profits now is prudent:\n- RSI above 85 historically leads to pullbacks\n- Profit target nearly reached\n- Better to secure +3% gain than risk reversal to stop-loss (-3.6%)\n- Portfolio is down -10.26%, need to protect gains\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION** - Taking profits due to extreme overbought conditions and proximity to profit target. This is a risk management decision to lock in gains before potential reversal.\n\n**Other Coins (BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP):**\n- BTC: RSI 91.207 - Extremely overbought, no position, not entering at these levels\n- ETH: RSI 92.913 - Dangerously overbought, no position, avoiding\n- SOL: RSI 77.159 - Overbought but less extreme, no position\n- BNB: RSI 67.344 - Moderate, but MACD negative, no clear setup\n- XRP: RSI 87.651 - Extremely overbought, no position\n\nAll major coins are showing overbought conditions.

Be highly selective - only take high-probability setups\n2. Use tight risk management (1-1.5% risk per trade max)\n3. Avoid chasing overbought conditions\n4. Wait for better entries or skip this cycle\n\n## Final Decision\nAll coins are showing overbought conditions after strong rallies. BTC and ETH are extremely overbought (RSI 85+). While SOL has the most balanced setup, entering now after such strong moves across the board carries high reversal risk. \n\nGiven my current drawdown and the need to preserve capital, I will **PASS on all entries** and wait for either:\n- Healthy pullbacks to support levels\n- Clear breakout confirmations with momentum reset\n- Better risk/reward setups\n\nSometimes the best trade is no trade.

Price is only $0.00216 (1.1%) above invalidation condition\n2. 15x leverage amplifies risk significantly\n3. RSI at 22.808 shows panic selling, but no reversal signal yet\n4. Price below EMA20 confirms bearish momentum\n5. Already down $184.60 with high leverage exposure\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nWhile RSI is extremely oversold (which could suggest a bounce), the invalidation condition is critically close. Given:\n- 15x leverage (high risk)\n- Price hovering just above invalidation\n- Strong bearish momentum (RSI crash from 87 to 22)\n- Already negative P&L\n- No clear reversal signals\n\nThe prudent risk management decision is to **CLOSE** this position to protect capital. The invalidation level is too close for comfort with 15x leverage, and the technical picture shows continued weakness. Better to take a small loss than risk a larger one if price breaks through $0.1920.\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- BTC: RSI 18.022 (extremely oversold), but price at $108,019 down from $111,161 - severe selling pressure\n- ETH: RSI 14.585 (extremely oversold), similar severe decline\n- SOL: RSI 22.168 (oversold), declining\n- BNB: RSI 11.736 (most oversold), severe weakness\n- XRP: RSI 35.448, relatively strongest but still weak\n\n**Market Context:**\nBroad market selloff across all assets. This is not the time to enter new positions with such extreme oversold conditions and no clear reversal signals. Wait for stabilization.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 33750.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.2095,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.1922,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.1920 (EMA20 support break) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 450.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - price at $0.19416 dangerously close to invalidation level ($0.1920), only 1.1% buffer with 15x leverage.

I need to be selective and wait for high-probability setups.\n\n### Market Overview:\nAll major coins are showing SHORT-TERM BEARISH signals with oversold conditions developing:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Price: $108,245 (below EMA20: $109,400)\n- RSI(7): 36.1 (oversold territory)\n- RSI(14): 42.5 (approaching oversold)\n- MACD: 729 (declining from 994)\n- Recent action: Sharp drop from $113,386 to $108,245 (-4.5%)\n- Below EMA20 suggests bearish momentum\n- Volume elevated (15,849 vs avg 6,615) - high volatility\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Price: $3,870 (below EMA20: $3,951)\n- RSI(7): 33.9 (oversold)\n- RSI(14): 39.0 (oversold)\n- MACD: 9.97 (declining sharply from 34.4)\n- Recent drop from $4,082 to $3,870 (-5.2%)\n- Volume elevated (141,710 vs avg 98,118)\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Price: $185.54 (below EMA20: $188.85)\n- RSI(7): 36.1 (oversold)\n- RSI(14): 41.7 (approaching oversold)\n- Recent drop from $196.14 to $185.54 (-5.4%)\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Price: $1,056.50 (below EMA20: $1,094.90)\n- RSI(7): 27.8 (deeply oversold)\n- RSI(14): 32.5 (oversold)\n- MACD: -6.26 (negative and declining)\n- Weakest performer - down from $1,111.50 to $1,056.50 (-5.0%)\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Price: $2.42 (below EMA20: $2.44)\n- RSI(7): 36.1 (oversold)\n- RSI(14): 44.3 (neutral-bearish)\n- Still relatively close to EMA\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Price: $0.19385 (below EMA20: $0.19627)\n- RSI(7): 34.9 (oversold)\n- RSI(14): 42.1 (approaching oversold)\n\n## Trading Decision:\n\n**STRATEGY:** Looking for mean reversion bounce opportunities on oversold conditions. BNB shows the most extreme oversold readings (RSI 7-period at 27.8), but this could indicate continued weakness. \n\n**BEST OPPORTUNITY:** ETH or BTC for a potential bounce:\n- Both have RSI(7) in oversold territory (33-36)\n- Both trading below EMA20 but not catastrophically far\n- High volume suggests capitulation may be near\n- 4-hour context shows they're still above 50-EMA (longer-term support)\n\n**DECISION:** I will enter a LONG position on **ETH** for a mean reversion play:\n- Most oversold on RSI(7): 33.9\n- Price $3,870 vs EMA20 $3,951 (-2.1% below)\n- 4-hour EMA20 ($3,951) > 50-EMA ($3,929) - still in uptrend context\n- Tight stop-loss below recent low\n- Target: reversion to EMA20 area\n\nRisk management:\n- Position size: ~$1,500 exposure (15x leverage = $100 margin)\n- Stop-loss: $3,850 (below recent consolidation)\n- Profit target: $3,950 (near EMA20)\n- Risk: ~$300 (3.4% of account)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.39,\n      \"profit_target\": 3950.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3850.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price breaks below $3,850 or RSI(7) falls below 25 indicating deeper correction\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 300.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price remains above $3,850 and RSI(7) is above 25. While the position is precarious, the rules require the invalidation condition to be met before closing. The stop-loss at $3,850 will protect against further downside.\n\n## Market Opportunities\n\n**BTC:** Price at $108,289, below EMA20 ($109,207). RSI(7) at 37.274 (oversold), MACD declining (370.933). Downtrend but showing potential oversold bounce. Too risky in current volatile conditions.\n\n**SOL:** Price at $184.90, below EMA20 ($188.23). RSI(7) at 34.236 (oversold). Similar pattern to ETH - oversold but in downtrend. Not entering.\n\n**BNB:** Price at $1,070.80, below EMA20 ($1,088.82). RSI(7) at 42.222. Weak momentum. Avoiding.\n\n**XRP:** Price at $2.41, below EMA20 ($2.43). RSI(7) at 32.392 (oversold). Declining from recent highs. Not attractive.\n\n**DOGE:** Price at $0.191850, below EMA20 ($0.195793). RSI(7) at 29.098 (very oversold). Sharp decline from $0.204240. Too volatile.\n\n**Overall Market Assessment:** All coins showing weakness with prices below their EMA20s and declining MACD indicators. RSI levels are oversold across the board, but this could indicate further downside rather than immediate reversal. Risk management dictates staying defensive.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.39,\n      \"profit_target\": 3950.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3850.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price breaks below $3,850 or RSI(7) falls below 25 indicating deeper correction\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 300.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

MACD still declining steeply, suggesting continued downward momentum. Would need to see RSI stabilize and MACD divergence before entering.\n\n### ETH (Current: $3,803.60)\n- **Bearish signals**: Price below EMA20 ($3,907), negative MACD (-44.2), RSI(7) at 26.2 (deeply oversold)\n- **Recent action**: Dropped from $4,082 to $3,803\n- **Assessment**: Most oversold of all assets. RSI(7) at 26.2 and RSI(14) at 31.9 indicates potential bounce territory. However, MACD still deteriorating. High risk but potential mean reversion play.\n\n### SOL (Current: $180.00)\n- **Extremely bearish**: RSI(7) at 17.1 (extremely oversold), RSI(14) at 28.5\n- **Recent action**: Collapsed from $196 to $180\n- **Assessment**: Most oversold on RSI metrics. This level of oversold (RSI 17) typically precedes violent bounces, but timing is critical. Price significantly below EMA20 ($186.38).\n\n### BNB (Current: $1,070.80)\n- **Moderately bearish**: RSI(7) at 44.5 (neutral), price below EMA20 ($1,086)\n- **Recent action**: Recovered slightly from lows\n- **Assessment**: Least oversold, showing relative strength. Not compelling for entry.\n\n### XRP (Current: $2.36)\n- **Bearish**: RSI(7) at 18.9 (extremely oversold), price below EMA20 ($2.42)\n- **Recent action**: Declined from $2.52 to $2.36\n- **Assessment**: Extremely oversold like SOL. High volume (10.5M vs 7.2M avg) suggests capitulation.\n\n### DOGE (Current: $0.18978)\n- **Bearish**: RSI(7) at 25.3 (oversold), price below EMA20 ($0.195)\n- **Recent action**: Down from $0.204 to $0.190\n- **Assessment**: Oversold but not as extreme as SOL/XRP.\n\n## Trading Decision Rationale\n\nGiven my significant drawdown (-12.51%), I need to be extremely selective. The market is showing oversold conditions across the board, which could present mean reversion opportunities, but I need clear risk/reward setups.\n\n**SOL** presents the most compelling technical setup:\n- RSI(7) at 17.1 is extremely oversold (typically bounces occur below 20)\n- RSI(14) at 28.5 confirms oversold\n- High volume (1.04M vs 749K avg) suggests potential capitulation\n- Clear risk management: entry at $180, stop below recent lows\n\n**Risk Management Strategy**:\n- Use 15x leverage to maximize capital efficiency while maintaining strict stop-loss\n- Risk only $500 (5.7% of capital) on this mean reversion trade\n- Tight stop-loss at $176 (2.2% below entry) to limit downside\n- Profit target at $190 (5.6% gain) for favorable 2.5:1 risk/reward\n- Invalidation: If price breaks below $176, the oversold bounce thesis is wrong\n\nThis is a tactical mean reversion play on extreme oversold conditions, not a trend-following trade.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 41.67,\n      \"profit_target\": 190.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 176.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $176 on 3-minute candle, indicating failed bounce from oversold levels\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, there are concerning signs:\n1. Price remains below EMA20 ($185.90), indicating downward pressure\n2. MACD still negative (-1.684)\n3. RSI showing only modest recovery from extreme oversold levels\n4. Volume is below average (523K vs 754K average)\n\nThe position is still valid as the invalidation condition has not been triggered. The recent bounce from $180 to $182.79 suggests some buying interest, but momentum is weak. Given that we're 20 minutes into trading with a -11.35% total return, I need to be cautious but also give winning trades room to work.\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - The invalidation condition is not met, price is above stop-loss, and there's a small profit. Will continue monitoring for either profit target ($190) or stop-loss ($176) to be hit.\n\n## Market Overview for Other Coins:\n- **BTC**: Weak momentum, below EMA20, RSI neutral at 51.9 - no clear setup\n- **ETH**: Weak, below EMA20, RSI 40.7 (bearish) - no setup\n- **BNB**: At EMA20, RSI 64.8 showing strength, but MACD negative - mixed signals, not compelling\n- **XRP**: Below EMA20, RSI 35.8 (weak), declining - no setup\n- **DOGE**: Below EMA20, RSI 39.5 (weak), declining - no setup\n\nNo new positions warranted given current market weakness across all coins and existing portfolio drawdown.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 41.67,\n      \"profit_target\": 190.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 176.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $176 on 3-minute candle, indicating failed bounce from oversold levels\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Risk of short-term pullback exists but trend is clearly up.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,859.40, EMA20: $3,890.13 (still below EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 50.07 (neutral, dropped from 64.28)\n- RSI(14): 45.98 (below 50 - weak)\n- MACD: -35.17 (still negative, improving slowly)\n- Price action: Failed to break above EMA20, showing weakness\n- **Assessment:** Weak setup. Not trading above key resistance. Pass.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $191.13, EMA20: $187.31 (trading above EMA - bullish)\n- RSI(7): 80.92 (extremely overbought)\n- RSI(14): 65.85 (overbought)\n- MACD: -0.43 (nearly positive, strong improvement from -2.10)\n- Price action: Explosive move from $180.00 to $191.13 (+6.2% in 30 minutes)\n- Crossed above EMA20 and maintaining momentum\n- **Assessment:** Strongest momentum of all coins but RSI extremely extended. High risk of immediate pullback.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,117.20, EMA20: $1,094.27 (trading above EMA - bullish)\n- RSI(7): 63.61 (bullish but not overbought)\n- RSI(14): 61.21 (healthy bullish)\n- MACD: 1.42 (positive crossover confirmed!)\n- Price action: Strong move from $1,070.80 to $1,130.10, slight pullback to $1,117.20\n- Above EMA20 with MACD positive\n- **Assessment:** Best risk/reward setup. Strong momentum without extreme overbought conditions.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.41, EMA20: $2.42 (below EMA - neutral/bearish)\n- RSI(7): 56.56 (neutral)\n- RSI(14): 48.13 (below 50 - weak)\n- MACD: -0.018 (still negative)\n- **Assessment:** Weak setup, consolidating below EMA. Pass.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.19577, EMA20: $0.19478 (just above EMA)\n- RSI(7): 72.90 (overbought)\n- RSI(14): 57.84 (moderate)\n- MACD: -0.001 (nearly neutral)\n- **Assessment:** Moderate setup but less conviction than BNB.\n\n**Trading Decision:**\nGiven the account is down -2.79% with Sharpe ratio of -0.862, I need to be selective and choose the highest probability setup. BNB offers the best combination of:\n1. Confirmed MACD positive crossover\n2. Trading above EMA20\n3. Strong RSI but not extremely overbought (unlike SOL at 80.92)\n4. Clear momentum with manageable pullback\n\nI'll enter ONE position in BNB with conservative risk management.

Currently, price is above EMA20 ($1103.40 > $1101.46), so the full invalidation condition is NOT met yet.\n\n**Technical analysis:**\n- RSI(7) at 34.252 shows oversold conditions and weakening momentum\n- RSI(14) at 47.732 confirms bearish pressure\n- MACD at 11.902 is still positive but declining from 13.459\n- Price just dropped sharply from $1124.80 to $1103.40 (-$21.40 in one candle)\n- Price is only $1.94 above EMA20, showing weak support\n- Volume is below average (9712 vs 10182), suggesting weak buying pressure\n\n**Risk assessment:**\nThe position is dangerously close to invalidation. If price drops just $1.94 more to break below EMA20 while RSI remains below 40 (which it likely will), the invalidation condition will be fully met. The sharp recent drop and oversold RSI suggest continued downward pressure.\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION**\nReasoning: While the strict invalidation condition isn't technically met yet (price still above EMA20), the position is exhibiting significant weakness:\n- RSI(7) already below 40 threshold\n- Price only $1.94 from triggering full invalidation\n- Sharp momentum shift to the downside\n- Risk/reward no longer favorable given proximity to invalidation\n\nThis is prudent risk management - better to exit with a small loss (-$9.62) than wait for full invalidation which could result in a larger loss near the stop-loss level.\n\n**Other coins (BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE):**\nNo existing positions. Market showing mixed signals with recent pullbacks across most assets. Not entering new positions given current volatility and lack of clear setups.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.67,\n      \"profit_target\": 1165.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1085.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,085 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 40 while price is below EMA20\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"RSI(7) dropped below 40 threshold to 34.252, price only $1.94 above EMA20 invalidation level.

Price remains well above $188.50 and RSI(7) is at 70.29 (far above 40). The position is slightly profitable and showing continued bullish momentum. However, RSI is elevated which suggests caution for new entries but not an exit signal for existing positions.

Let me review each coin:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Price: $111,669 (above EMA20: $110,413)\n- RSI(7): 72.06 - moderately overbought but not extreme\n- MACD: 781.84 - strong positive momentum\n- Price above both 20 and 50 EMA on 4H timeframe\n- Recent pullback from 111,635 to 111,396, now recovering to 111,669\n- Trend: Strong uptrend with healthy momentum\n- Volume: Lower than average (2,462 vs 6,155) - caution flag\n- Assessment: Bullish but entering at elevated levels with low volume is risky\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Price: $3,957.60 (above EMA20: $3,903.56)\n- RSI(7): 72.27 - similar overbought level to BTC\n- MACD: 26.81 - positive and strengthening\n- Strong recovery from $3,890 low\n- Volume: 28,811 vs avg 74,942 - significantly below average\n- Assessment: Bullish momentum but low volume concerns\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Price: $194.42 (above EMA20: $190.42)\n- RSI(7): 68.51 - approaching overbought\n- MACD: 2.34 - positive momentum\n- Recent volatility: dropped to $189.29, recovered strongly\n- Volume: 218,770 vs avg 601,978 - very low volume\n- Assessment: Bullish but weak volume\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Price: $1,115.70 (above EMA20: $1,107.54)\n- RSI(7): 56.61 - neutral zone, most balanced\n- MACD: 7.15 - positive but weakening (declining from 12.08)\n- Recent volatility with pullback to $1,103\n- Volume: 2,722 vs avg 8,967 - very low\n- Assessment: Weakest momentum of major coins\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Price: $2.60 (above EMA20: $2.49)\n- RSI(7): 98.46 - EXTREMELY overbought (danger zone!)\n- RSI(14): 93.73 - also extremely overbought\n- MACD: 0.048 - strong positive momentum\n- Parabolic move from $2.44 to $2.60 in 30 minutes\n- Volume: 7,722,765 vs avg 5,627,422 - ABOVE average (only coin with strong volume)\n- Assessment: Extreme overbought but has momentum and volume.

The market shows:\n- Most coins have low volume (red flag for sustainability)\n- XRP has extreme RSI but actual volume support\n- BTC/ETH/SOL have decent momentum but low volume\n\n**Strategy:** I'll take ONE calculated position in XRP despite extreme RSI because:\n1. It's the ONLY coin with above-average volume (actual buying pressure)\n2. Strong MACD momentum suggests continuation possible\n3. Clear trend from $2.44 to $2.60\n4. Tight stop-loss to manage the overbought risk\n5. Small position size due to high risk\n\nRisk management:\n- Position size: ~$500 risk (5% of capital)\n- Tight stop-loss at $2.52 (3% below entry)\n- Profit target at $2.72 (4.6% gain)\n- 15x leverage for position sizing\n- Invalidation: RSI(7) drops below 80 OR price closes below $2.54\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1923,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.72,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.52,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If RSI(7) drops below 80 OR price closes below $2.54 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

While RSI is currently at 85.824 (above 80), the rapid decline from 98+ levels and the extreme overbought condition on both RSI(7) and RSI(14) suggests imminent mean reversion. The RSI was at 84.001 just one candle ago, which was dangerously close to triggering the invalidation.\n\n**Technical Context:**\n- Price is $0.10 above the EMA20 ($2.50) - stretched\n- Strong uptrend but showing signs of exhaustion\n- Volume declining (2.7M vs avg 5M)\n- At 15x leverage, any pullback will be amplified\n\n**Decision:** CLOSE POSITION\nReason: While the strict invalidation condition hasn't been met yet (RSI still above 80), we're in extreme danger zone. RSI dropped from 98.771 to 84.001 to 85.824 - this volatility near the invalidation threshold combined with extreme overbought readings on both timeframes suggests high probability of dropping below 80 very soon. Better to exit with minimal loss (-$8.85) than risk a sharp reversal that could trigger stop-loss at $2.52 (which would be a $161+ loss on this position). This is prudent risk management given the 15x leverage and overbought extremes.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- **BTC**: RSI(7) at 44.918 - neutral/slightly bearish. MACD declining. Price above EMA20 but momentum fading. No clear setup.\n- **ETH**: RSI(7) at 43.967 - similar to BTC. Price above EMA20 but weak momentum. No clear setup.\n- **SOL**: RSI(7) at 48.349 - neutral. Price above EMA20. Consolidating. No clear edge.\n- **BNB**: RSI(7) at 58.942 - neutral/bullish. Price above EMA20. Modest uptrend but not compelling.\n- **DOGE**: RSI(7) at 27.751 - oversold! Price below EMA20. Declining sharply. Could be a reversal setup but risky after sharp drop.\n\nNone of the other coins present compelling risk/reward setups at this moment. With account down -3.59%, better to preserve capital and wait for clearer opportunities.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 1923.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.72,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.52,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If RSI(7) drops below 80 OR price closes below $2.54 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - RSI(7) declining rapidly from extreme overbought levels (98.771 \u2192 84.001 \u2192 85.824), dangerously close to invalidation threshold of 80.

Too risky to enter at these levels.\n\n**SOL**: RSI 81.663 (overbought), price 197.78 vs EMA 192.41. Momentum strong but already extended.\n\n**BNB**: RSI 86.271 (extremely overbought), similar to BTC. Avoid new positions at these extremes.\n\n**XRP**: RSI 94.001 (CRITICALLY overbought - highest reading), price 2.65 vs EMA 2.53. This is parabolic and dangerous.\n\n**DOGE**: RSI 80.480 (overbought), price 0.201760 vs EMA 0.196547. Extended move.\n\n**Conclusion**: All coins showing extreme overbought conditions. This is a market-wide euphoria signal. The prudent action is to take profits on BTC and wait for healthier entry points. No new positions warranted at these extreme RSI levels.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.15,\n      \"profit_target\": 114500.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 110200.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 110200 (below recent support and EMA20 zone) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 192.79,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Taking profits at extreme overbought levels - RSI 86.757 indicates high reversal risk.

Portfolio is down -1.53% with a negative Sharpe ratio (-0.242), indicating poor risk-adjusted returns so far.\n\nAnalyzing market conditions for potential entry opportunities:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $113,734 vs EMA20: $111,346 (+2.1% above)\n- RSI(7): 89.2 - EXTREMELY overbought (danger zone)\n- RSI(14): 83.6 - Also very overbought\n- MACD: 814.157 - Strong positive momentum\n- Price action: Sharp rally from $111,057 to $113,734 (+2.4% in 30 minutes)\n- **Assessment:** While momentum is strong, RSI levels above 85-90 typically signal imminent pullback. Too risky to enter at these extended levels.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $4,074.90 vs EMA20: $3,944.59 (+3.3% above)\n- RSI(7): 89.0 - EXTREMELY overbought\n- RSI(14): 82.1 - Very overbought\n- MACD: 36.064 - Strong positive\n- Price action: Rally from $3,921 to $4,074 (+3.9% in 30 minutes)\n- **Assessment:** Same issue as BTC - severely overbought. High probability of near-term reversal.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $199.44 vs EMA20: $193.15 (+3.3% above)\n- RSI(7): 86.0 - EXTREMELY overbought\n- RSI(14): 78.8 - Overbought\n- MACD: 1.958 - Positive momentum\n- **Assessment:** Also overbought but slightly less extreme than BTC/ETH.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,133.50 vs EMA20: $1,116.18 (+1.6% above)\n- RSI(7): 80.0 - Overbought\n- RSI(14): 70.2 - Moderately overbought\n- MACD: 6.398 - Positive\n- **Assessment:** Less extended than others, but still overbought.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.64 vs EMA20: $2.54 (+3.9% above)\n- RSI(7): 84.6 - Very overbought\n- RSI(14): 88.5 - EXTREMELY overbought\n- MACD: 0.061 - Positive\n- **Assessment:** Extremely overbought conditions.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.20299 vs EMA20: $0.19708 (+3.0% above)\n- RSI(7): 83.6 - Very overbought\n- RSI(14): 76.4 - Overbought\n- MACD: 0.001 - Weak positive\n- **Assessment:** Overbought with weaker momentum than others.\n\n## Trading Decision Rationale\n\n**ALL assets are showing extreme overbought conditions** with RSI(7) readings between 80-89. This is a classic \"chase the pump\" trap. The prudent risk management approach is to:\n\n1. **WAIT for pullback** - Entering at these levels has very poor risk/reward\n2. **Avoid FOMO** - The rally has already happened; we missed it\n3. **Preserve capital** - Better to miss a move than to enter at the top and get stopped out\n4. **Look for reversion** - These RSI levels typically precede 2-5% corrections\n\nGiven that I'm already down -1.53% with poor risk-adjusted returns, I need to be MORE selective, not less. Chasing overbought momentum would violate sound risk management principles.\n\n**CONCLUSION:** Stand aside. No trades. Wait for healthier entry conditions (RSI < 70, price near EMA support, or clear reversal patterns).\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

Too risky to enter here despite strong momentum. Would need to see consolidation or pullback to 112,000-113,000 area.\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- **Price action**: Explosive move from 3,931 to 4,160 (+5.8%)\n- **Technical indicators**:\n  - RSI(7): 91.98 - EXTREMELY overbought (highest of all coins)\n  - RSI(14): 86.92 - Dangerously overbought\n  - MACD: 53.10 - Strong bullish momentum\n  - Price far above EMA20 (4,160 vs 3,975)\n- **Volume**: 128,704 vs avg 58,272 - Massive volume spike (2.2x)\n- **Assessment**: Most extended of all assets. RSI above 90 on both timeframes is unsustainable. High probability of sharp reversal. AVOID.\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- **Price action**: Rally from 192.65 to 200.05 (+3.8%)\n- **Technical indicators**:\n  - RSI(7): 81.70 - Overbought but not extreme\n  - RSI(14): 76.57 - Moderately overbought\n  - MACD: 1.857 - Positive and strengthening\n  - Price above EMA20 (200.05 vs 194.69)\n- **Volume**: 799,911 vs avg 470,913 - Strong volume (1.7x)\n- **Assessment**: Less extended than BTC/ETH. Still overbought but more manageable levels. Could have room to 205-210 if market stays hot.\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- **Price action**: Recovery from 1,108 to 1,138 (+2.7%)\n- **Technical indicators**:\n  - RSI(7): 73.13 - Elevated but not extreme\n  - RSI(14): 68.14 - Moderately bullish\n  - MACD: 3.514 - Turned positive recently\n  - Price above EMA20 (1,138 vs 1,122)\n- **Volume**: 4,479 vs avg 5,504 - Below average volume\n- **Assessment**: Least extended, most reasonable entry. Lower volume is concerning but RSI levels are tradeable. Best risk/reward of the majors.\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- **Price action**: Strong move from 2.56 to 2.65 (+3.5%)\n- **Technical indicators**:\n  - RSI(7): 70.17 - Just above overbought threshold\n  - RSI(14): 75.88 - Moderately overbought\n  - MACD: 0.057 - Positive momentum\n  - Price above EMA20 (2.65 vs 2.56)\n- **Volume**: 9,364,077 vs avg 5,176,831 - Very high volume (1.8x)\n- **Assessment**: Pulled back from extreme levels (RSI was 99+ earlier). Now at more reasonable overbought levels with strong volume. Interesting setup.\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- **Price action**: Rally from 0.1949 to 0.2057 (+5.5%)\n- **Technical indicators**:\n  - RSI(7): 82.22 - Overbought\n  - RSI(14): 76.98 - Moderately overbought\n  - MACD: 0.002 - Positive but small magnitude\n  - Price above EMA20 (0.2057 vs 0.1986)\n- **Volume**: 37,127,227 vs avg 14,939,075 - Massive volume (2.5x)\n- **Assessment**: Strong momentum with huge volume. Meme coin volatility risk but trend is strong.\n\n## Trading Decision Rationale\n\nGiven the extremely overbought conditions across the board (BTC RSI 90.86, ETH RSI 91.98), I'm facing a difficult decision:\n\n1. **Risk of chasing**: Entering at these extreme RSI levels historically leads to quick reversals\n2. **Risk of missing out**: Strong trends can stay overbought longer than expected\n3. **Account recovery**: Down -1.53%, need to make careful decisions\n\n**Strategy**: I will take ONE position in the least extended coin with best risk/reward. BNB shows:\n- Lowest RSI levels (73/68) - still overbought but not extreme\n- Recently turned bullish (MACD just went positive)\n- Tight stop-loss possible due to recent consolidation\n- If this market leg continues, BNB should follow BTC/ETH higher\n\nI'll use conservative position sizing (risk ~$300) with tight stop-loss given market conditions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 1165.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1125.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1125 on 3-minute candle or if RSI(7) reaches 95+ indicating parabolic exhaustion\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 390.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Profit target is within easy reach (0.72% move)\n\nHowever, RSI(7) at 86.115 suggests we're in the late stages of this move. The risk/reward here is unfavorable - we're risking $31.70 to the stop-loss to gain $8.30 to the profit target. This is a poor risk/reward ratio.\n\n**DECISION: CLOSE POSITION** - Taking profits near target.

Need to be selective and find high-probability setups.\n\n## Market Analysis by Coin\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $115,377 | EMA20: $112,961 (strong uptrend, +2.1% above EMA)\n- RSI(7): 84.6 (overbought but not extreme)\n- RSI(14): 84.17 (confirming overbought)\n- MACD: 1,056.6 (very strong bullish momentum)\n- Price action: Strong rally from $111,271 to $115,566, now slight pullback to $115,377\n- Concern: RSI previously hit 94.47, now cooling to 84.6 - potential exhaustion\n- Decision: **PASS** - Too extended, RSI cooling suggests pullback risk\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $4,162.80 | EMA20: $4,042.50 (+3.0% above EMA)\n- RSI(7): 65.83 (healthy pullback from 94.02 extreme)\n- RSI(14): 72.63 (still elevated but not extreme)\n- MACD: 59.34 (strong positive momentum)\n- Price action: Strong move from $3,931 to $4,206, now consolidating at $4,162\n- Volume: 69,935 vs avg 56,227 (above average, confirming strength)\n- Decision: **PASS** - RSI cooling rapidly (94\u219266), suggests deeper correction possible\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $200.17 | EMA20: $196.77 (+1.7% above EMA)\n- RSI(7): 51.26 (neutral, cooled from 90.92)\n- RSI(14): 59.64 (neutral zone)\n- MACD: 2.44 (positive but modest)\n- Price action: Rallied to $204.39, now pulled back to $200.17\n- Decision: **PASS** - Losing momentum, RSI drop from 90\u219251 shows weakening\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,180 | EMA20: $1,133.36 (+4.1% above EMA)\n- RSI(7): 93.08 (EXTREMELY overbought)\n- RSI(14): 86.56 (very overbought)\n- MACD: 9.38 (accelerating upward)\n- Price action: Explosive move from $1,116 to $1,180 (+5.7%)\n- Volume: 6,554 vs avg 5,352 (+22% above average)\n- Assessment: This is a parabolic move with extreme RSI. High risk but strong momentum.\n- Decision: **BUY** - Momentum trade with tight stops. RSI 93 is extreme but MACD accelerating and volume confirming. Will use 15x leverage for smaller position size with tight risk management.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.63 | EMA20: $2.58 (+1.9% above EMA)\n- RSI(7): 50.24 (neutral, cooled from 94.28)\n- RSI(14): 63.14 (neutral)\n- MACD: 0.046 (positive but weakening)\n- Decision: **PASS** - Momentum fading, RSI collapsed from 94\u219250\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.20314 | EMA20: $0.20046 (+1.3% above EMA)\n- RSI(7): 47.74 (neutral/weak, down from 84.67)\n- RSI(14): 57.37 (neutral)\n- MACD: 0.002 (positive but flat)\n- Decision: **PASS** - Weak momentum, RSI declining\n\n## Trading Decision\n\nOnly BNB shows continuation potential despite extreme RSI. The MACD acceleration, volume confirmation, and price breaking to new highs suggest this could continue. However, this is HIGH RISK due to extreme overbought conditions. Will enter with:\n- Tight stop-loss at $1,145 (3% below current, below recent consolidation)\n- Profit target at $1,230 (4.2% gain, conservative given extension)\n- 15x leverage to keep position size manageable\n- Risk: ~$300 (3% of account)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 3.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 1230.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1145.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,145 or RSI(7) forms bearish divergence with lower high in price\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 300.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price remains in a strong uptrend with positive MACD, price above EMA20, and RSI cooling from overbought levels which is healthy. The minor pullback from $115,566 to $114,960 is normal consolidation. All exit conditions (stop-loss, invalidation) are far from being triggered.\n\n## Other Coins - Opportunity Assessment\n\n**ETH**: Strong momentum (RSI 75, MACD 75.98), price $4,194 above EMA $4,060. Already up significantly but no position to avoid overconcentration.\n\n**SOL**: RSI 49.5 (neutral), MACD 2.817 (positive but weakening), price $199.97 near EMA $196.98. Consolidating after recent spike to $204. Not compelling.\n\n**BNB**: RSI 47 (neutral/weak), price $1,144 near EMA $1,132. Recent spike to $1,180 rejected. Momentum fading.\n\n**XRP**: RSI 77.2 (strong), MACD 0.040, price $2.67 above EMA $2.60. Volume doubled. Strong but already extended.\n\n**DOGE**: RSI 47.6 (neutral), MACD 0.002, price $0.203 near EMA $0.2006. Consolidating, no clear edge.\n\n**Conclusion**: No new positions warranted. BTC position remains valid with strong technical setup.

The invalidation condition has NOT been met - price is still above $111,000\n2. Stop-loss has NOT been hit - current price $114,111 > $111,500\n3. RSI showing oversold on 7-period (34.82) suggests potential bounce\n4. Price remains above EMA20, maintaining bullish structure\n5. The pullback appears to be a healthy retracement after overbought conditions (RSI was 94.89)\n6. MACD still positive, though weakening momentum\n7. Price is consolidating above key support levels\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Position is slightly underwater but within acceptable drawdown\n- All exit conditions remain valid and not triggered\n- Market structure still bullish with price above moving averages\n- 15x leverage requires close monitoring, but position sizing is appropriate\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe invalidation condition explicitly states \"closes below $111,000\" - we are currently at $114,111, which is $3,111 above that level. The stop-loss at $111,500 also has not been breached. The recent pullback from extreme overbought levels (RSI 94.89) to oversold (RSI 34.82) is a natural correction. The uptrend structure remains intact with price above EMA20 and MACD still positive. This is a normal retracement, not a trend reversal.\n\n**HOLD** - No exit conditions met. Position remains valid within risk parameters.\n\n## Other Markets:\nNo positions in ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP, or DOGE. Not initiating new trades as:\n- Portfolio already has significant BTC exposure ($71,889 notional)\n- Current drawdown of -9.09% suggests risk management focus\n- Better to manage existing position than add new exposure\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.63,\n      \"profit_target\": 118500.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 111500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $111,000 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown of uptrend structure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 2200.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price is $2,903 above the $111,000 invalidation level. However, this is a concerning situation:\n1. Sharp pullback from highs (-$1,663 in 30 minutes)\n2. RSI crashed from 94.873 to 30.199 - extreme reversal\n3. Stop-loss at $111,500 is only $2,403 away (2.1% drop)\n4. Position is underwater by $722\n\n**Decision Rationale**:\nWhile the invalidation condition is NOT technically met, the rapid momentum shift and proximity to stop-loss warrants caution. The RSI(7) at 30.199 suggests potential short-term bounce, but the 15x leverage amplifies risk. Given:\n- Price holding above invalidation ($111,000)\n- Still above stop-loss ($111,500)\n- Oversold RSI could mean bounce\n- MACD still positive at 912.781\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - Invalidation condition not met, but monitor closely. If next candle closes below $111,500, stop-loss will be hit.\n\n## Other Coins Analysis\n\n### ETH\n- Current: $4,093.40 | RSI(7): 31.908 (oversold) | Similar pattern to BTC\n- No position, similar pullback pattern, not entering new trades in current volatility\n\n### SOL\n- Current: $201.24 | RSI(7): 62.230 | Above EMA20 ($198.05)\n- Recovering better than BTC/ETH, but no position and avoiding new entries\n\n### BNB\n- Current: $1,137.50 | RSI(7): 39.738 | Weak momentum\n- No compelling setup\n\n### XRP\n- Current: $2.63 | RSI(7): 41.996 | Sideways consolidation\n- No strong signal\n\n### DOGE\n- Current: $0.199570 | RSI(7): 23.695 (extremely oversold)\n- Below EMA20, weakest performer, avoiding\n\n## Risk Management Assessment\n- Portfolio down -10.49% with Sharpe ratio of -0.515\n- Single BTC position at 15x leverage with $71,758 notional exposure\n- Available cash: $4,889.38 (54.6% of account)\n- Position is 8x account value due to leverage\n\nGiven the high leverage and current drawdown, I will not add new positions.

Price remains well above $111,000 threshold. The recent pullback from $115,566 to $113,903 was a healthy consolidation after an overbought RSI reading (94.839). Now RSI has normalized to 50.928, MACD remains positive, and price is recovering above EMA20. The uptrend structure is intact. No reason to exit this position.\n\n### Other Coins Analysis (No Positions)\n\n**ETH**: \n- Price: $4,111.80, strong above EMA20 ($4,080.68)\n- RSI cooling from overbought (was 94.648, now 41.936)\n- MACD positive but declining\n- Not entering - already have BTC exposure, portfolio concentration risk\n\n**SOL**: \n- Price: $199.69, slightly above EMA20 ($198.63)\n- RSI: 43.254 - neutral/weak\n- Choppy price action, no clear directional bias\n- Not entering - insufficient conviction\n\n**BNB**: \n- Price: $1,131.80, below EMA20 ($1,133.99)\n- RSI: 33.529 - weak, declining momentum\n- Sharp rejection from $1,180 spike\n- Not entering - bearish short-term structure\n\n**XRP**: \n- Price: $2.64, above EMA20 ($2.62)\n- RSI: 52.955 - neutral\n- Ranging between $2.63-$2.67\n- Not entering - no clear setup\n\n**DOGE**: \n- Price: $0.199650, below EMA20 ($0.200736)\n- RSI: 29.421 - oversold but weak\n- Declining from $0.206800 high\n- Not entering - bearish momentum\n\n## Risk Management Assessment\n- Current account value: $9,251.40\n- Available cash: $4,889.38\n- Single position (BTC) at 15x leverage: $72,040.50 notional\n- Unrealized loss: -$440.68\n- Portfolio return: -7.49%\n\nThe BTC position represents significant leverage but the invalidation condition provides clear risk parameters.

MACD declining but still positive - trend weakening but not reversed\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- With 15x leverage, a move to stop-loss ($111,500) would result in ~$2,200 loss\n- Current drawdown is only $854 - well within risk tolerance\n- Oversold RSI suggests potential for mean reversion bounce\n- However, momentum is clearly bearish with declining MACD\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe invalidation condition explicitly states \"if price closes below $111,000\" - this has NOT occurred. Current price is $113,694, which is $2,694 above the invalidation level. The position should be held according to the exit plan, especially given:\n- Deeply oversold RSI suggesting bounce potential\n- Stop-loss provides adequate protection at $111,500\n- No technical invalidation has occurred\n- Selling into extreme oversold conditions is typically poor risk/reward\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- ETH: RSI 18.86 - extremely oversold, but no position\n- SOL: RSI 21.12 - oversold, but no position  \n- DOGE: RSI 12.96 - critically oversold, but no position\n- BNB: RSI 29.99 - oversold, but no position\n- XRP: RSI 53.19 - neutral, consolidating\n\nAll coins showing oversold conditions suggest market-wide selling pressure.

I need to analyze whether any coins present good entry opportunities.\n\n### Market Overview:\nAll major coins are showing significant weakness:\n- **BTC**: Down to 112,502 from recent highs around 115,000. RSI(7) at extreme oversold 16.0, RSI(14) at 29.6\n- **ETH**: Down to 3,996.90. RSI(7) at 23.9 (oversold), RSI(14) at 32.5\n- **SOL**: Down to 193.95. RSI(7) at 16.8 (extreme oversold), RSI(14) at 30.2\n- **BNB**: Down to 1,103.70. RSI(7) at 16.0 (extreme oversold), RSI(14) at 27.5\n- **XRP**: Down to 2.61. RSI(7) at 29.1, RSI(14) at 38.1 (least oversold)\n- **DOGE**: Down to 0.1929. RSI(7) at 6.5 (EXTREMELY oversold), RSI(14) at 19.2\n\n### Technical Analysis:\n\n**BTC**: \n- Price 112,502 well below EMA20 (113,580)\n- MACD declining from 920 to 301 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI(7) at 16 is extreme oversold territory\n- Volume below average (3,339 vs 4,734)\n- Sharp selloff in progress but may be nearing capitulation\n\n**ETH**:\n- Price 3,996.90 below EMA20 (4,064)\n- MACD declining from 59 to 11 (weakening)\n- RSI(7) at 23.9 oversold\n- Volume low (45,199 vs 75,730)\n- Following BTC's weakness\n\n**SOL**:\n- Price 193.95 below EMA20 (197.58)\n- MACD near zero (0.260) - momentum exhausted\n- RSI(7) at 16.8 extreme oversold\n- Volume weak (386,349 vs 640,838)\n\n**BNB**:\n- Price 1,103.70 below EMA20 (1,128.46)\n- MACD turned negative (-1.477)\n- RSI(7) at 16.0 extreme oversold\n- Volume very low (2,967 vs 6,869)\n\n**DOGE**:\n- Price 0.1929 significantly below EMA20 (0.1988)\n- MACD negative (-0.001)\n- RSI(7) at 6.5 - MOST oversold of all coins\n- Volume weak (7.29M vs 22.2M)\n- This is capitulation territory\n\n### Trading Decision:\n\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions across the board, especially in DOGE (RSI 6.5), BTC (RSI 16), SOL (RSI 16.8), and BNB (RSI 16), there's a potential for a mean reversion bounce. However, the momentum is clearly bearish with declining MACDs and prices below EMAs.\n\n**Strategy**: I'll take a SMALL contrarian position in DOGE given its extreme oversold RSI of 6.5 - this is historically rare and often precedes sharp bounces. I'll use tight risk management with a small position size.\n\nI'll avoid BTC/ETH despite oversold readings because they're the market leaders and if they continue falling, alts will follow. DOGE's extreme reading suggests potential for a quick bounce trade.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 21500,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.1990,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.1900,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.1900 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 20 within 6 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 415.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, the position is extremely risky:\n1. Stop-loss is dangerously close (0.22% away)\n2. Low volume suggests weak buying pressure\n3. Price remains below EMA20\n4. While RSI shows oversold bounce, the trend is still weak\n\nGiven the proximity to stop-loss and weak market structure, I should CLOSE this position for risk management. The stop-loss is so close that any minor move could trigger it, and the risk/reward is no longer favorable. Better to take the small profit and preserve capital.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC: Neutral, price near EMA20, RSI neutral (50.5) - no strong setup\n- ETH: Weak, below EMA20, RSI low (39.4) - bearish\n- SOL: Weak, below EMA20, RSI low (40.8) - bearish\n- BNB: Weak, below EMA20, RSI low (44.2) - bearish\n- XRP: Neutral consolidation, RSI 57.6 - no clear edge\n\nNo new positions warranted given weak market conditions across the board.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 21500.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.199,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.19,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.1900 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 20 within 6 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 415.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - stop-loss too close (0.22% away), low volume bounce lacks conviction, taking small profit to preserve capital\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

I need to carefully evaluate whether current market conditions present good entry opportunities.\n\n### Market Overview:\nAll major coins are showing significant bearish pressure:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $110,675 vs EMA20: $113,349 (-2.4%)\n- RSI(7): 16.1 - EXTREMELY oversold (below 20)\n- RSI(14): 22.3 - Severely oversold\n- MACD: -542.5 - Strong bearish momentum, accelerating downward\n- Price dropped from $114,640 to $110,675 in last 30 minutes (-3.5%)\n- Volume: 19,763 vs avg 5,889 (3.35x above average) - HIGH SELLING PRESSURE\n- Trading below both 20 and 50 EMA on 4H timeframe\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,903 vs EMA20: $4,047 (-3.6%)\n- RSI(7): 13.6 - EXTREMELY oversold (most oversold of all coins)\n- RSI(14): 20.9 - Severely oversold\n- MACD: -37.2 - Strong bearish momentum\n- Price dropped from $4,116 to $3,903 (-5.2%)\n- Volume: 293,984 vs avg 97,748 (3x above average) - PANIC SELLING\n- Most vulnerable coin right now\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $192.75 vs EMA20: $197.74 (-2.5%)\n- RSI(7): 28.3 - Oversold but not extreme\n- RSI(14): 33.1 - Approaching oversold\n- MACD: -1.235 - Bearish but less severe than others\n- Dropped from $202.32 to $192.75 (-4.7%)\n- Volume: 3,017,569 vs avg 819,572 (3.68x above average)\n- Relatively stronger than BTC/ETH\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,106.70 vs EMA20: $1,123.85 (-1.5%)\n- RSI(7): 40.8 - Neutral territory, showing recovery\n- RSI(14): 38.2 - Approaching neutral\n- MACD: -8.239 - Bearish but stabilizing\n- Most resilient of major coins\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.59 vs EMA20: $2.63 (-1.5%)\n- RSI(7): 26.0 - Oversold\n- RSI(14): 33.2 - Approaching oversold\n- MACD: -0.006 - Minimal bearish pressure\n- Volume spike: 39.4M vs avg 9M (4.36x)\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.1939 vs EMA20: $0.1979 (-2.0%)\n- RSI(7): 45.3 - Neutral, recovering\n- RSI(14): 38.3 - Approaching neutral\n- MACD: -0.003 - Minimal bearish pressure\n- Volume: 207.8M vs avg 33.4M (6.22x above average)\n- Showing recovery momentum\n\n## Trading Decision Logic:\n\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions (particularly BTC RSI at 16.1 and ETH at 13.6), we're likely near a short-term bounce point. However, the massive volume spikes indicate genuine selling pressure, not just a quick flush.\n\n**Risk Considerations:**\n1. Down -36.59% already - need to be cautious\n2. No positions = no immediate risk, but missing potential bounce\n3. RSI extremes often lead to mean reversion bounces\n4. High volume selloffs can continue before reversal\n\n**Strategy:**\nI will enter ONE small position on the most oversold coin (ETH) with tight risk management, targeting a mean reversion bounce back toward EMA20. This is a tactical scalp, not a trend trade.\n\nETH chosen because:\n- Most extreme RSI readings (13.6 on 7-period)\n- Clear distance to EMA20 for profit target\n- High volume suggests capitulation phase\n- Risk/reward favorable for bounce play\n\nPosition sizing: Conservative at 10x leverage with ~$500 risk (7.9% of capital)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.3,\n      \"profit_target\": 4047.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3865.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,865 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 10\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 497.29\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

RSI(7) hovering just above invalidation threshold (13.487 vs 10.0)\n2. Strong downward momentum with MACD deeply negative and worsening\n3. Price well below EMA20 with no signs of reversal\n4. Position essentially flat but in deteriorating market conditions\n5. All major coins showing severe weakness (BTC RSI 13.152, ETH RSI 13.487)\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThis is a borderline case. While the strict invalidation conditions haven't been met yet, the position is in extreme danger:\n- RSI is just 3.5 points above the invalidation threshold\n- The downtrend is accelerating (MACD getting more negative)\n- We're in a broader market selloff affecting all coins\n- Risk/reward is poor given the momentum\n\nHowever, following the rules strictly: invalidation has NOT been met. The position should be held BUT monitored extremely closely. Given the RSI is so close to 10 and momentum is clearly negative, the next candle could easily trigger invalidation.\n\n**Conservative Approach:** Given we're down 36.66% on the account and this position is teetering on the edge of invalidation, I'm going to HOLD but acknowledge this is high-risk. If the next update shows any further deterioration, immediate closure would be warranted.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n- **BTC**: RSI(7) 13.152 - Extremely oversold but in freefall, no position\n- **SOL**: RSI(7) 38.638 - Showing relative strength but still below EMA\n- **BNB**: RSI(7) 41.918 - Neutral but weak\n- **XRP**: RSI(7) 16.840 - Extremely oversold\n- **DOGE**: RSI(7) 36.784 - Weak momentum\n\n**New Position Consideration:**\nWith the account down 36.66% and all major coins in severe oversold territory, this could be a capitulation bottom. However:\n- No clear reversal signals yet\n- MACD still deteriorating across the board\n- Prices still below EMAs\n- Risk of further downside remains high\n\n**Conclusion:** Not opening new positions. The market needs to show stabilization first. Will hold ETH position as invalidation technically not met, but this is precarious.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.3,\n      \"profit_target\": 4047.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3865.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,865 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 10\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 497.29\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The risk of further downside is too high. Better to wait for:\n- RSI to show divergence or recovery above 30\n- Price to reclaim EMA20 levels\n- MACD to show bullish crossover\n- Volume to stabilize\n\nPreserving my remaining $6,303.93 is more important than trying to time a bounce that may not come immediately.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

Account value is $6,303.93 with -36.96% total return.\n\n**TRADING OPPORTUNITY ASSESSMENT:**\nThese are textbook oversold conditions. RSI(7) below 15 on multiple major assets simultaneously is rare and typically marks capitulation bottoms. However, given:\n1. My current drawdown of -37%\n2. The severity of the downtrend (all EMAs pointing down)\n3. No clear reversal signals yet (just oversold conditions)\n4. Risk management after significant losses\n\n**DECISION:**\nI will look for the MOST oversold asset with the best risk/reward setup for a mean reversion trade. ETH shows RSI(7) = 6.60, which is the lowest reading, indicating extreme panic selling. This presents a counter-trend opportunity with tight stop-loss.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious. The better strategy here is to wait for an actual reversal signal (price starting to move up, RSI divergence, or first green candle) rather than catching a falling knife.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions but lack of reversal confirmation, I will enter ONE small position in ETH (the most oversold) with very tight risk management. This is a mean reversion play with the understanding that we're in a strong downtrend.\n\nPosition sizing: With $6,303.93 available and current losses, I'll risk only $300 (4.8% of capital) on this trade.\n\nETH entry at $3,688, targeting bounce to $3,850 (4.4% move), stop-loss at $3,625 (1.7% below entry).\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.81,\n      \"profit_target\": 3850.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3625.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price falls below 3625 or RSI(7) drops below 5.0 indicating continued capitulation\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 300.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
