I need to analyze the current market conditions across all coins and identify the best entry opportunities.\n\n## Market Overview Analysis\n\n**BTC (109160):**\n- Price significantly below EMA20 (111104.55), showing downtrend\n- MACD deeply negative (-1429.362) but showing slight improvement from -1438.859\n- RSI(7) at 43.856, recovering from oversold territory (was 20.827)\n- Price bounced from 108211 to 109160, showing potential reversal\n- Below both 20 and 50 period EMAs on 4H (bearish structure)\n- Recent sharp drop from 111405 to 108211 (-2.9%)\n\n**ETH (3930.90):**\n- Price below EMA20 (4023.44), downtrend\n- MACD negative (-71.784) but improving slightly from -72.725\n- RSI(7) at 45.554, recovering from 21.372 oversold\n- Similar pattern to BTC - sharp drop then bounce\n- Price bounced from 3864.90 low\n- Below both EMAs on 4H timeframe\n\n**SOL (186.91):**\n- Price well below EMA20 (195.30)\n- MACD negative (-5.057), worsening slightly\n- RSI(7) at 35.557, still in recovery from 19.011\n- Weakest recovery of the major coins\n- Dropped from 196.80 to 184.76, now at 186.91\n\n**BNB (1149.30):**\n- Price significantly below EMA20 (1188.16)\n- MACD negative (-31.536), improving slightly\n- RSI(7) at 37.756, recovering from 28.369\n- Moderate bounce pattern\n\n**XRP (2.36):**\n- Price below EMA20 (2.44)\n- MACD negative (-0.058), stable\n- RSI(7) at 41.475, showing decent recovery from 20.237\n- Best RSI recovery among all coins\n\n**DOGE (0.190230):**\n- Price below EMA20 (0.198261)\n- MACD negative (-0.005)\n- RSI(7) at 37.342, recovering from 18.498\n- Dropped from 0.200260 to 0.187720\n\n## Trading Decision Logic\n\nAll coins are showing similar patterns: sharp selloffs followed by initial bounces. This suggests a coordinated market move, likely driven by BTC. The key question is whether this is a dead cat bounce or the start of a reversal.\n\n**Bullish signals:**\n- RSI values recovering from deeply oversold levels (20s)\n- MACD showing slight improvement (less negative)\n- All coins bouncing from their lows\n- Volume spike during the drop suggests capitulation\n\n**Bearish signals:**\n- All prices still below EMA20\n- MACD still deeply negative\n- Bearish trend structure on 4H timeframes\n- Weak volume on the bounce\n\n**Risk Management Strategy:**\nGiven this is my first trade with $10,000, I should:\n1. Start with 1-2 positions maximum\n2. Risk no more than 2% per trade ($200)\n3. Use moderate leverage (10-15x)\n4. Focus on coins showing strongest recovery signals\n\n**Best Opportunity: ETH**\n- RSI(7) recovered from 21.372 to 45.554 (strongest momentum shift)\n- Clear support level at 3864.90\n- Better risk/reward with clear stop-loss placement\n- MACD improving\n\n**Alternative: XRP**\n- Best RSI reading at 41.475\n- Smaller coin, more volatile (higher risk/reward)\n- Clear bounce pattern\n\nI'll enter a long position on ETH with tight risk management, as it shows the strongest recovery momentum and has clear technical levels for stop-loss placement.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4100.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3850.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3850 on 3-minute candle, indicating failed bounce and continuation of downtrend\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 200.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

This represents a potential mean-reversion opportunity, but timing is critical.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Extreme oversold readings typically lead to bounces\n- However, momentum is strongly negative across all assets\n- Need to wait for signs of stabilization before entering\n- BNB and SOL show the most extreme oversold readings (RSI 9.5 and 16.4)\n\n**Decision:** WAIT - Do not enter positions during a falling knife scenario. While oversold conditions suggest a bounce is coming, there's no sign of stabilization yet. All MACD indicators are accelerating downward, and prices are well below EMAs. Better to wait for:\n1. RSI to start recovering from extreme levels\n2. Price to show stabilization or reversal candles\n3. MACD to show divergence or slowing decline\n\nEntering now would be catching a falling knife. Will monitor for reversal signals in subsequent candles.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

Still below EMA20 but showing some recovery\n- **Decision**: **HOLD** - Invalidation condition NOT met. Price above stop-loss, RSI has bounced above 30\n\n### BNB Position Analysis\n- **Entry**: 1071.7, **Current**: 1074 (+0.2%, +$9.70 PnL)\n- **Exit Plan**: Profit target 1120, Stop-loss 1045\n- **Invalidation**: \"If price breaks below 1,045 or fails to reclaim 1,100 within next 5 candles\"\n- **Status Check**:\n  - Price is ABOVE stop-loss (1045) \u2713 (current 1074 vs stop 1045)\n  - Price has NOT broken below 1045 \u2713\n  - Reclaim 1100 condition: We're at candle 4 since entry, price is 1074, far from 1100\n  - RSI(7) at 20.8 - extremely oversold, historically dangerous territory\n  - MACD at -22.7 showing strong negative momentum\n  - Price dropped from 1183 to 1062 (massive -10% drop), now barely recovering\n- **Risk Assessment**: BNB showing extreme weakness. While technically above stop-loss, the \"fail to reclaim 1100 within 5 candles\" condition is concerning. We're on candle 4, and price is still 26 points below entry and 26 points away from 1100. Given the extreme oversold RSI (20.8) and severe downtrend, this position is at high risk.\n- **Decision**: **HOLD** - Technically invalidation NOT fully met yet (still above 1045, and we have 1 more candle for the 1100 reclaim attempt). However, monitoring closely.\n\n## New Position Opportunities\n\nGiven the broad market selloff and all coins trading below their EMAs with negative MACD, this is NOT an ideal time to open new positions. The market needs to show stabilization first. All coins are in downtrends with no clear reversal signals yet.\n\n## Risk Management Summary\n- Portfolio down -0.15% (minimal drawdown)\n- Both positions slightly profitable but in weakening markets\n- No clear invalidation triggers met yet\n- Maintaining disciplined approach to exit plans\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.06,\n      \"profit_target\": 109500.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 103500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price breaks below 103,500 or RSI(7) fails to bounce above 30 within next 5 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 390.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 1120.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1045.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price breaks below 1,045 or fails to reclaim 1,100 within next 5 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 430.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

While technically the invalidation hasn't been fully met yet, the extreme oversold RSI(7) at 17.93 and proximity to stop-loss (only $21 away) presents high risk.

The RSI(7) did drop below 30 (hit 17.66 at the low) but has since bounced to 35.05. However, it hasn't achieved a strong bounce \"above 30 within next 5 candles\" - it only marginally recovered. More critically, the price is still well above the 103,500 stop-loss level.\n\nThe invalidation condition is partially met (RSI did fail to show strong recovery above 30 quickly), but the position is showing small profit and hasn't hit stop-loss. The market appears to be in a consolidation phase after a sharp drop.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Market is showing extreme volatility (dropped ~5% then recovered slightly)\n- MACD still deeply negative (-1,589), suggesting downtrend continuation risk\n- RSI bouncing but not convincingly - could retest lows\n- Price below EMA20 indicates bearish short-term trend\n- 15x leverage on a volatile asset carries significant risk\n\n**Decision on BTC:** \nGiven the weak RSI recovery (only to 35, not a strong bounce), deeply negative MACD, and price below EMA20, the invalidation condition is borderline met. The RSI did not show a strong bounce above 30 within the timeframe specified. While we're in small profit, the technical setup remains weak. Risk management suggests closing this position to preserve capital and avoid potential whipsaw in this volatile environment.\n\n## Other Market Opportunities\n\n**ETH:** Price 3,830.70, RSI(7) 45.61 - Oversold bounce potential but still below EMA20 (3,926). Not compelling enough.\n\n**SOL:** Price 181.89, RSI(7) 38.26 - Similar weak recovery pattern to BTC. Below EMA20. Pass.\n\n**BNB:** Price 1,070.60, RSI(7) 25.06 - Extremely oversold but showing no reversal signal yet. Too risky.\n\n**XRP:** Price 2.29, RSI(7) 39.82 - Oversold but no clear reversal. Below EMA20.\n\n**DOGE:** Price 0.18472, RSI(7) 43.47 - Slight recovery but momentum unclear.\n\n**Overall Market Assessment:**\nAll coins show similar pattern - sharp selloff with weak recovery attempts. MACD deeply negative across all assets. This suggests a broader market downturn. Not an ideal environment for new long positions. Better to preserve capital and wait for clearer reversal signals.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.06,\n      \"profit_target\": 109500.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 103500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price breaks below 103,500 or RSI(7) fails to bounce above 30 within next 5 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 390.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation condition partially met - RSI(7) failed to show strong recovery above 30 within specified timeframe (only reached 35.05 from extreme oversold 17.66).

The recovery is tepid (price still below EMA20), and with 15x leverage, the risk of another downturn is significant.\n\n**Risk Management:**\n- Current unrealized profit: +$17.56 (small gain)\n- Better to take the small profit and respect the invalidation rule\n- Market showing mixed signals with declining momentum across most coins\n- Portfolio performance: -0.79% overall return\n\n## Market Context for Other Coins:\n- **BTC**: Below EMA20, negative MACD, RSI neutral at 48 - weak trend\n- **ETH**: Below EMA20, improving but still weak, RSI 56.9 - consolidating\n- **SOL**: Below EMA20, negative MACD, RSI 51 - no clear setup\n- **BNB**: Significantly below EMA20 ($1090 vs $1119), RSI 44 - bearish\n- **DOGE**: Below EMA20, negative MACD, RSI 57 - weak recovery\n\n**Conclusion:** No new trade setups present clear risk/reward opportunities.

Unable to break decisively above EMA20 despite multiple attempts\n2. Very low volume (only 32% of average) - lacks conviction\n3. Price oscillating around entry with minimal progress\n4. While not technically hitting the $3,860 invalidation level yet, the failure to break EMA20 is concerning\n5. The position is barely holding above water with -$129 unrealized loss\n\nHowever, the strict invalidation condition requires price to close below $3,860, which hasn't happened yet. Current price is $3,887.40, which is $27.40 above the $3,860 threshold.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- With 15x leverage and $74,793 notional exposure, this position represents significant risk\n- Account value: $9,743.85\n- This single position is 7.7x my account value in notional terms\n- Stop-loss at $3,820 would trigger a loss of approximately $1,387 (14.2% of account)\n\n**Final Decision on ETH:** HOLD\nWhile the position shows weakness, the invalidation condition has NOT been met. Price is still above $3,860 and hasn't closed below it. The stop-loss at $3,820 provides protection. I will hold and let the position work, but monitor closely for any close below $3,860.\n\n## Other Coins Analysis\n\n**BTC:** No position. Price $107,143 below EMA20 ($107,939), negative MACD (-1,026), RSI 55. Downtrend not confirmed yet but no clear entry signal.\n\n**SOL:** No position. Price $187.47 above EMA20 ($186.90), improving MACD (-1.921), RSI 71 (overbought). Showing strength but RSI too extended for safe entry.\n\n**BNB:** No position. Price $1,092 well below EMA20 ($1,112.86), negative MACD (-17.767), RSI 44. Weak trend, no entry signal.\n\n**XRP:** No position. Price $2.36 slightly above EMA20 ($2.35), improving MACD (-0.011), RSI 57. Neutral, no strong signal.\n\n**DOGE:** No position. Price $0.18947 above EMA20 ($0.18923), improving MACD (-0.002), RSI 72.6 (overbought). Similar to SOL - showing strength but overbought.\n\n**Conclusion:** Will hold ETH position as invalidation not met. No new positions warranted - market showing mixed signals with low volume across the board.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 19.24,\n      \"profit_target\": 4050.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3820.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,820 (2% below entry) or fails to break above EMA20 and closes back below $3,860\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

While RSI shows overbought conditions on the 7-period, the 14-period RSI at 56.8 is still reasonable. MACD is improving. The position is profitable and showing momentum.

High probability of pullback/consolidation. Too risky to enter at these levels.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Price: $3,983.70 (strong rally)\n- RSI(7): 86.2 - EXTREMELY overbought (highest of all coins)\n- RSI(14): 75.4 - overbought\n- MACD: 16.1 (positive and rising)\n- Price above EMA20 ($3,898.88) - bullish\n- **Assessment:** Even more overbought than BTC. RSI above 85 typically signals imminent reversal or consolidation. Not entering at peak.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Price: $188.81\n- RSI(7): 58.5 - neutral/healthy\n- RSI(14): 59.5 - neutral\n- MACD: 0.664 (positive, small)\n- Price above EMA20 ($186.53) - mildly bullish\n- Recent pullback from $190.67 high\n- **Assessment:** Most balanced RSI levels. Showing healthy consolidation after recent move. However, momentum is weakening (RSI dropped from 80.4 to 58.5). Not compelling enough for entry.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Price: $1,116.10\n- RSI(7): 69.4 - approaching overbought\n- RSI(14): 59.5 - neutral\n- MACD: -5.2 (negative, improving)\n- Price above EMA20 ($1,104.60) - bullish\n- Below 50-EMA ($1,115.68) - resistance overhead\n- **Assessment:** Recovering from oversold but MACD still negative. Mixed signals. Not strong enough setup.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Price: $2.40\n- RSI(7): 72.1 - overbought\n- RSI(14): 65.4 - moderately overbought\n- MACD: 0.012 (barely positive)\n- Price above EMA20 ($2.35) - bullish\n- **Assessment:** Overbought conditions developing. Weak MACD signal. Pass.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Price: $0.19669\n- RSI(7): 86.2 - EXTREMELY overbought (tied with ETH)\n- RSI(14): 77.2 - overbought\n- MACD: 0.002 (positive)\n- Price well above EMA20 ($0.18986) - strong bullish\n- +9 cent rally from $0.1877 to $0.1967\n- **Assessment:** Massively overbought. RSI at 86.2 is unsustainable. High risk of sharp pullback.\n\n**OVERALL MARKET ASSESSMENT:**\n- All coins showing bullish price action above their EMAs\n- However, 4 out of 6 coins have RSI(7) > 70 (overbought)\n- BTC, ETH, and DOGE all have RSI(7) > 83 (extreme overbought)\n- This suggests a market-wide overbought condition\n- High probability of consolidation or pullback across the board\n\n**RISK MANAGEMENT DECISION:**\nGiven the extreme overbought conditions across the entire market (especially BTC and ETH which are the market leaders), entering new positions now would be chasing momentum at dangerous levels. The prudent decision is to wait for:\n1. Pullback to healthier RSI levels (50-60 range)\n2. Consolidation and base-building\n3. Clear technical setups with better risk/reward\n\nWith a 14.38% return and strong Sharpe ratio of 11.35, I should preserve capital and wait for better entry opportunities rather than forcing trades in overextended conditions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

RSI has cooled from overbought levels, suggesting momentum may be waning.\n\n**DOGE Position Analysis:**\n- Entry: 0.19527, Current: 0.200190 (+2.52%)\n- Unrealized P&L: +$217.01\n- Profit target: 0.205 (just 2.44% away)\n- Stop-loss: 0.188500\n- Invalidation condition: Close below 0.188500\n- Current status: Price at 0.200190, well above invalidation at 0.188500 \u2713\n- Technical indicators: RSI(7) = 75.675 (elevated but not extreme), MACD = 0.005 (positive), EMA20 = 0.191467 (price well above EMA)\n- Latest candle: 0.200190, down from 0.201150 (small pullback)\n- Decision: **CLOSE POSITION** - Similar to SOL, we're close to profit target with good gains secured. The pullback from 0.201150 to 0.200190 suggests some profit-taking. With +$217 profit, locking in gains is prudent given we're 10 minutes into trading and both positions are showing profit.\n\n**Other Coins (BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB):**\n- BTC: RSI(7) = 85.817 (extremely overbought), price at 110,996 after massive rally. Too risky to enter at these levels.\n- ETH: RSI(7) = 74.557, price at 4,033.50. Also extended, recent pullback from 4,053.40.\n- XRP: RSI(7) = 75.136, showing strength but already extended.\n- BNB: RSI(7) = 50.811, most neutral but recent pullback from 1,127.90 to 1,114.60.\n- Decision: **NO NEW POSITIONS** - All coins are either overbought or showing pullback signs. Better to take profits on existing positions and wait for clearer setups.\n\n**Risk Management Summary:**\n- Both positions are profitable and near targets\n- Total unrealized P&L: +$420.82\n- Current return: 18.78%\n- Closing both positions locks in excellent gains and reduces risk exposure\n- Cash position will be strong for next opportunities\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 48.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 184.50,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 184.50 on 3-minute candle, indicating breakdown of uptrend structure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 550.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Taking profits near target - price at 192.11 is 1.77% from profit target of 195.50, with +$203.81 unrealized gain secured.

Current price is $3,980.40, which is $60.40 above the invalidation level. The position has NOT been invalidated. Price remains above EMA20 and support.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n- Invalidation condition: NOT MET \u2713\n- Stop-loss: NOT HIT ($3,980.40 > $3,920.00) \u2713\n- Profit target: NOT REACHED ($3,980.40 < $4,200.00)\n- Technical structure: Still intact, price above EMA20\n- RSI has cooled from extreme overbought levels (good for continuation)\n- Small drawdown of -0.57% is within acceptable risk parameters\n\n**Conclusion:** HOLD position. The trade thesis remains valid. The recent pullback from $4,053 to $3,980 is a healthy consolidation after the strong rally. RSI cooling from 93 to 40 creates room for another leg up. Price structure remains bullish above EMA20 and support.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** Strong uptrend (price $110,753 well above EMA20 $108,753), but RSI at 70.251 showing overbought. No position currently. Not entering at these extended levels.\n\n**SOL:** Price $188.77 slightly above EMA20 $187.94, but RSI declining to 37.959 showing weakness. MACD declining. Not attractive for entry.\n\n**BNB:** Price $1,100.90 just below EMA20 $1,101.76, RSI at 32.170 showing weakness. MACD declining. Bearish short-term structure.\n\n**XRP:** Strong momentum with RSI at 89.376 (extremely overbought). Price $2.52 well above EMA20 $2.40. Too extended for safe entry - high risk of reversal.\n\n**DOGE:** RSI at 66.693, price $0.1995 above EMA20 $0.1937. Decent momentum but no compelling setup after recent rally.\n\n**Risk Management:** Currently using $1,472.75 notional ($98.18 in margin at 15x leverage) out of $11,740.89 available. Only 0.83% of capital at risk. Conservative position sizing allows room for additional opportunities if they arise.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.37,\n      \"profit_target\": 4200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3920.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,920 on 3-minute candle (breaks EMA20 and support)\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 236.81\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The RSI(7) at 39.26 shows oversold conditions on the short timeframe, suggesting potential bounce. Price remains above EMA20 ($3946.42) and well above our stop-loss. The MACD is still positive (43.49), indicating the uptrend structure is intact. The pullback appears to be profit-taking rather than trend reversal.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Distance to stop-loss: $58.10 (1.46%)\n- Small unrealized loss of $9.99 is acceptable\n- Position size: 0.37 ETH with 15x leverage = $1,471 notional\n- No immediate danger signals\n\n**DECISION: HOLD** - Invalidation condition not met, technical structure intact, oversold RSI suggests potential bounce.\n\n## Other Coins Analysis\n\n### BTC\n- Strong uptrend: $110,479 well above EMA20 ($108,863.56)\n- RSI(7): 58.71 - cooling from overbought (was 91.91)\n- MACD: 1128.95 - strong positive momentum\n- Price consolidated after spike to $111,161\n- **No position, but strong setup developing**\n\n### SOL\n- Price: $189.64 slightly above EMA20 ($187.99)\n- RSI(7): 47.25 - neutral, recovering from 37.99\n- MACD: 1.97 - positive but weakening\n- Choppy price action, not compelling\n\n### BNB\n- Price: $1100.20 at EMA20 ($1100.54)\n- RSI(7): 31.36 - oversold after pullback\n- MACD: 9.21 - declining from 13.08\n- Weak momentum, avoiding\n\n### XRP\n- Price: $2.49 well above EMA20 ($2.41)\n- RSI(7): 66.05 - healthy after spike to 89.39\n- MACD: 0.046 - positive and rising\n- Strong uptrend, but already extended\n\n### DOGE\n- Price: $0.19995 above EMA20 ($0.19423)\n- RSI(7): 70.00 - at overbought threshold\n- MACD: 0.004 - positive momentum\n- Decent setup but lower conviction\n\n**New Position Considerations:**\nGiven I have $11,740.89 available cash and only one small position (-$9.99), I could add exposure.

We're only $2.60 away from the stop-loss trigger. The invalidation condition states \"if price closes below $3,920 on 3-minute candle\" - we need to check if the current candle has closed below this level.\n\nLooking at the price action:\n- Latest price: $3,922.60 (still above $3,920 but barely)\n- Price has dropped from $3,978.10 to $3,922.60 in the last candle\n- RSI(7) at 20.02 indicates extreme oversold conditions - potential bounce territory\n- Price is below EMA20 ($3,944.83), which was part of the invalidation warning\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe position is on the edge of its stop-loss. While the extreme RSI oversold reading (20.02) could indicate a potential bounce, risk management principles dictate that we should respect our stop-loss. The price is trading at $3,922.60, which is only $2.60 above our stop-loss of $3,920.00. Given the volatility and the fact that we're below EMA20 (part of our invalidation condition), the prudent decision is to **CLOSE THE POSITION** to protect capital and prevent further losses.\n\nThe invalidation condition is essentially met: price is below EMA20 and hovering at the stop-loss level. Better to exit now with a small loss (-$30.53) than risk a larger drawdown if momentum continues downward.\n\n## Market Scan for New Opportunities\n\n**BTC:** \n- Current: $109,008 | EMA20: $108,873.94\n- RSI(7): 26.89 - oversold\n- Sharp drop from $110,479 to $109,008\n- Below recent highs but showing oversold conditions\n- Could be a bounce opportunity but momentum is clearly bearish\n\n**SOL:**\n- Current: $185.46 | EMA20: $187.74\n- RSI(7): 24.15 - very oversold\n- Price below EMA20\n- Similar pattern to ETH - selling pressure\n\n**BNB:**\n- Current: $1,081.30 | EMA20: $1,099.32\n- RSI(7): 16.02 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- Significant drop from $1,118.50\n- Most oversold of all coins\n\n**XRP:**\n- Current: $2.45 | EMA20: $2.41\n- RSI(7): 45.06 - neutral zone\n- Price ABOVE EMA20 (bullish relative to others)\n- MACD still positive at 0.045\n- Best relative strength among all coins\n\n**DOGE:**\n- Current: $0.19652 | EMA20: $0.19451\n- RSI(7): 33.77 - oversold but not extreme\n- Price above EMA20\n- Showing better resilience than most\n\n**Trading Decision:**\nGiven the broad market selloff across all major coins, the safest approach is to:\n1. Close the ETH position to preserve capital (invalidation condition met)\n2. Wait for clearer reversal signals before entering new positions\n3. Extreme oversold readings could lead to bounces, but the momentum is clearly bearish across the board\n\nThe market is showing coordinated selling pressure. While oversold conditions often precede bounces, the risk of catching a falling knife is high. Better to stay in cash and wait for confirmation of reversal.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.37,\n      \"profit_target\": 4200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3920.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,920 on 3-minute candle (breaks EMA20 and support)\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 236.81,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Stop-loss proximity triggered - price at $3,922.60 is only $2.60 above stop-loss of $3,920.00.

I need to evaluate potential entry opportunities.\n\n### Market Overview:\nAll major coins are showing sharp pullbacks from recent highs with extremely oversold RSI readings:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Price: $108,019 (down from $111,161 high)\n- RSI(7): 18.02 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 35.28 - oversold territory\n- MACD: 691.8 declining from 1003.97\n- Price below EMA20 ($108,879.80) but still above 50-EMA ($108,027.29)\n- Sharp selloff from overbought conditions (RSI was 91.89)\n- This is a classic pullback after parabolic move\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Price: $3,891.90 (down from $4,053.40 high)\n- RSI(7): 14.59 - EXTREMELY oversold (lowest of all coins)\n- RSI(14): 30.72 - oversold\n- MACD: 19.76 declining from 40.07\n- Price below EMA20 ($3,945.06) but above 50-EMA ($3,913.62)\n- Volume elevated at 109,088 vs avg 71,049\n- Most oversold major asset\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Price: $184.93 (down from $192.93 high)\n- RSI(7): 22.17 - extremely oversold\n- RSI(14): 34.60 - oversold\n- MACD: 0.615 declining\n- Price below EMA20 ($187.86)\n- Volume elevated: 638,140 vs avg 494,199\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Price: $1,071.30 (down from $1,127.90 high)\n- RSI(7): 11.74 - MOST oversold of all assets\n- RSI(14): 26.74 - deeply oversold\n- MACD: -0.513 (turned negative)\n- Price significantly below EMA20 ($1,099.19)\n- Steepest decline\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Price: $2.43 (holding relatively well)\n- RSI(7): 35.45 - least oversold\n- RSI(14): 47.79 - near neutral\n- MACD: 0.032 still positive\n- Price above EMA20 ($2.42)\n- Showing relative strength\n- Volume spike: 13.38M vs avg 4.57M\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Price: $0.19416 (down from $0.20115)\n- RSI(7): 22.81 - extremely oversold\n- RSI(14): 41.28 - approaching oversold\n- MACD: 0.003 positive but declining\n- Price near EMA20 ($0.19476)\n\n### Trading Strategy:\n\nThis is a classic mean-reversion setup. After extreme overbought conditions (RSI 85-93 across the board), we're seeing healthy profit-taking pullbacks into deeply oversold territory. The key question is: are these pullbacks complete or will they extend further?\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. All coins showing extreme RSI oversold readings (11-35 on RSI7)\n2. MACD declining but not deeply negative (except BNB)\n3. Prices mostly above 50-EMA support levels\n4. This appears to be a correction within an uptrend, not a reversal\n5. Volume remains elevated, showing active participation\n\n**Best Entry Opportunity: ETH**\n- Most oversold (RSI7: 14.59)\n- Above 50-EMA support ($3,913.62)\n- Strong volume confirmation\n- Clear risk/reward setup\n- Entry at $3,891.90 with stop below $3,850 (below recent low and 50-EMA)\n\n**Alternative: BNB**\n- Second most oversold (RSI7: 11.74)\n- But MACD turned negative and price furthest from EMA20\n- Higher risk of further decline\n\n**Decision:** Enter long ETH position with tight risk management. The extreme oversold reading combined with support near 50-EMA provides excellent risk/reward for a mean-reversion trade.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 30,\n      \"profit_target\": 3980.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3850.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3850 (below 50-EMA support and recent low) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1258.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "# CHAIN OF THOUGHT\n\nReviewing my current position:\n\n**ETH Position Analysis:**\n- Entry: $3891.90, Current: $3890.10 (down $1.80, -0.05%)\n- Unrealized P&L: -$112.38 (-0.96% of notional)\n- Invalidation condition: \"If price closes below 3850 (below 50-EMA support and recent low) on 3-minute candle\"\n- Stop-loss: $3850, Profit target: $3980\n- Current EMA20: $3942.75 (price below EMA - bearish)\n- RSI(7): 14.200 - EXTREMELY OVERSOLD\n- RSI(14): 29.765 - Oversold territory\n- MACD: 9.138 (declining from 34.775 peak)\n\n**Critical Assessment:**\nThe ETH position is showing concerning weakness:\n1. Price has dropped from $4053.40 to $3890.10 in the last 30 minutes\n2. RSI(7) at 14.2 is in extreme oversold territory - this is near capitulation levels\n3. Price is now below the 20-EMA ($3942.75), indicating bearish momentum\n4. MACD declining rapidly from 34.775 to 9.138\n5. Current price $3890.10 is only $40 above the invalidation level of $3850\n6. The position is underwater by $112, though not yet at stop-loss\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nWhile the RSI at 14.2 suggests a potential bounce (oversold conditions often precede reversals), the position is dangerously close to its invalidation level. The price is only $40.10 away from $3850, which represents:\n- A mere 1.03% decline to hit invalidation\n- Below both 20-EMA and showing sustained selling pressure\n- The recent price action shows a sharp drop from $3980+ to $3890\n\nHowever, the invalidation condition states \"if price **closes** below 3850 on 3-minute candle.\" The current price is $3890.10, which is still $40 above the invalidation level. The extreme oversold RSI(7) at 14.2 suggests we may be at or near a short-term bottom.\n\n**Risk Management Consideration:**\n- Position size: $116,703 notional with 10x leverage = $11,670 capital deployed\n- Current loss: $112 (0.96% of capital at risk)\n- Distance to stop-loss: $40.10 (1.03%)\n- Distance to profit target: $89.90 (2.31%)\n\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions (RSI 14.2 is exceptionally low), I will **HOLD** the position but monitor very closely. If the next candle closes below $3850, the invalidation condition will be met and I must exit. The risk/reward here favors waiting for a potential bounce from these oversold levels.\n\n**Other Coins - No New Positions:**\n- BTC: RSI 33.958, below EMA, declining - not attractive\n- SOL: RSI 37.101, below EMA, weak momentum - pass\n- BNB: RSI 23.919 (oversold but bearish), below EMA - pass\n- XRP: RSI 38.327, slight uptrend but unconvincing - pass\n- DOGE: RSI 26.377, weak momentum - pass\n\nAll other coins show weakness or unclear setups. With limited capital ($74.31 available) and one leveraged position already at risk, I will not open new positions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 30.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 3980.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3850.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3850 (below 50-EMA support and recent low) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1258.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Account is up 73.60% with excellent Sharpe ratio of 12.27.\n\nLet me analyze the current market conditions for potential entry opportunities:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Price: $113,386 (up sharply from $108,565 just 3 minutes ago - massive spike)\n- RSI(7): 79.9 - overbought territory\n- RSI(14): 74.4 - still overbought\n- MACD: 844.89 - very strong positive momentum\n- Price well above EMA20 ($109,304) - strong uptrend\n- Volume: 22,444 vs avg 5,167 - massive 4.3x volume spike\n- Recent pattern: Sharp V-shaped recovery from $108,019 low\n- **Concern:** Just had a $4,800+ move in one candle - extreme volatility, likely exhaustion\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Price: $4,082.90 (up from $3,890.10 - $192 spike in one candle)\n- RSI(7): 78.1 - overbought\n- RSI(14): 70.6 - approaching overbought\n- MACD: 21.24 - positive and increasing\n- Price above EMA20 ($3,954.66)\n- Volume: 231,760 vs avg 81,485 - 2.8x volume spike\n- Similar V-shaped recovery pattern as BTC\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Price: $196.14 (up from $186.17 - $10 spike)\n- RSI(7): 79.5 - overbought\n- RSI(14): 70.5 - approaching overbought\n- MACD: 0.823 - positive momentum\n- Price above EMA20 ($188.66)\n- Volume: 1.45M vs avg 528K - 2.75x volume spike\n- Following BTC's pattern\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Price: $1,111.50 (up from $1,076.10)\n- RSI(7): 68.3 - elevated but not extreme\n- RSI(14): 58.5 - neutral zone\n- MACD: -2.844 - still negative (lagging indicator)\n- Price above EMA20 ($1,099.82)\n- Volume: 10,395 vs avg 6,623 - 1.57x increase\n- Weakest momentum of the majors\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Price: $2.52 (up from $2.43)\n- RSI(7): 72.7 - elevated\n- RSI(14): 68.0 - approaching overbought\n- MACD: 0.027 - positive but small\n- Price above EMA20 ($2.43)\n- Volume: 12.98M vs avg 5.05M - 2.57x spike\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Price: $0.20424 (up from $0.19443)\n- RSI(7): 77.5 - overbought\n- RSI(14): 71.9 - overbought\n- MACD: 0.003 - positive\n- Price above EMA20 ($0.19577)\n- Volume: 45M vs avg 20.9M - 2.15x spike\n\n## Trading Decision Logic\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. ALL coins showing synchronized massive spike in last candle - suggests market-wide event\n2. All RSI(7) readings between 68-80 - universally overbought\n3. All showing 2-4x volume spikes - high conviction move\n4. This appears to be a breakout or news-driven event affecting entire crypto market\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Entering after such extreme moves is very risky (chase risk)\n- However, strong volume and synchronized movement suggests institutional buying\n- With 73.6% returns already, I should be selective and disciplined\n- The V-shaped recovery from lows suggests strong buying pressure\n\n**Strategy:**\nGiven the extreme overbought conditions across ALL assets after massive single-candle spikes, the prudent approach is to **WAIT for a pullback**. Entering at these levels would be chasing momentum at peak RSI levels with poor risk/reward.\n\nHowever, if I must take action, BNB shows the most reasonable entry point with RSI(7) at 68.3 (lowest of all coins) and RSI(14) at 58.5 (still in neutral zone). But even this is questionable given the context.\n\n**Final Decision:** STAND ASIDE. No entries. The market just had an explosive move and all technical indicators are screaming overbought. Better to wait for consolidation or pullback to enter with better risk/reward. Preserving capital and maintaining discipline is more important than forcing trades.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

Account value is $16,658.21 with 66.58% total return and excellent Sharpe ratio of 10.24. I need to evaluate whether current market conditions present good entry opportunities.\n\n### Market Overview:\nAll major coins are showing similar patterns:\n- **Prices below EMA20**: BTC (108160 < 109294), ETH (3857 < 3942), SOL (185.16 < 188.66), BNB (1067 < 1091), XRP (2.42 < 2.43), DOGE (0.1937 < 0.1961)\n- **RSI (7-period) in oversold territory**: BTC 35.6, ETH 32.2, SOL 35.1, BNB 38.2, XRP 35.6, DOGE 34.4\n- **MACD weakening**: All coins showing declining or negative MACD momentum\n- **Recent volatility**: Sharp drop visible in price action (e.g., BTC from 113386 to 108160)\n\n### Individual Coin Analysis:\n\n**BTC**: Price dropped from 113386 to 108160 (-4.6%). RSI bouncing from 17.8 oversold to 35.6. MACD declining from 974 to 526. Currently 1.0% below EMA20. This looks like a potential bounce setup after washout.\n\n**ETH**: Similar pattern - dropped from 4083 to 3857 (-5.5%). RSI recovered from 14.1 to 32.2. MACD collapsed from 35.5 to 2.2. Price 2.2% below EMA20. Oversold bounce candidate.\n\n**SOL**: Dropped from 196 to 185 (-5.6%). RSI bounced from 21.7 to 35.1. MACD near zero (0.061). Price 1.9% below EMA20. Similar oversold setup.\n\n**XRP**: Most stable - only 2% below recent high. RSI 35.6, MACD still positive at 0.021. Price near EMA20. Weakest setup.\n\n**BNB**: Down from 1112 to 1067 (-4.0%). RSI 38.2, negative MACD at -5.8. Price 2.2% below EMA20. Oversold but weakest momentum.\n\n**DOGE**: Down from 0.204 to 0.194 (-5.1%). RSI 34.4, MACD near zero. Price 1.2% below EMA20.\n\n### Trading Decision:\n\nThe market shows classic oversold conditions after a sharp selloff. RSI levels in the 32-38 range suggest potential bounce. However, MACD momentum is still declining, which means we could see further downside before reversal.\n\n**BEST SETUP: BTC** - Largest market cap, most liquid, RSI showing early bounce signs, and price action suggests capitulation may be near. The spike to 113386 followed by sharp drop to 108160 looks like a liquidity grab/stop hunt.\n\n**RISK MANAGEMENT**: \n- Will enter ONE position only (BTC) to test the bounce\n- Use tight stop-loss below recent low\n- Risk 2% of capital ($333)\n- Set profit target at EMA20 resistance\n- Invalidation: If price breaks below 107000 (below recent low of 108019)\n\nI will enter BTC long with 15x leverage, targeting the EMA20 reversion trade.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.046,\n      \"profit_target\": 109500.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 106800.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 107000 on 3-minute candle, indicating failed bounce and continuation of downtrend\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 333.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The invalidation condition has NOT been met. However, price is showing weakness:\n- Below EMA20 consistently\n- MACD declining sharply\n- Failed to hold above 110000\n- Sitting just above our entry\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe position is barely profitable (+$3.45) and showing technical weakness. While the invalidation hasn't been triggered, we're seeing:\n1. Sustained price below EMA20\n2. Rapidly declining MACD momentum\n3. Price struggling near entry level\n4. Risk of further downside given the sharp recent drop\n\nHowever, the invalidation condition is CLEAR and has NOT been met (price is still above 107000). RSI at 37 suggests oversold conditions that could lead to a bounce. The position has proper stop-loss protection at 106800.\n\n**DECISION: HOLD** - Invalidation condition not met, stop-loss provides protection, oversold RSI suggests potential bounce.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- Current: 3866.90 | EMA20: 3937.11\n- RSI(7): 35.33 - oversold\n- MACD: -6.97 - negative and declining\n- Below EMA20, weak momentum\n- **Decision:** No position, market showing weakness, not entering\n\n### SOL Analysis  \n- Current: 184.90 | EMA20: 188.23\n- RSI(7): 34.24 - oversold\n- MACD: -0.14 - slightly negative\n- Below EMA20, similar weakness pattern\n- **Decision:** No position, not entering in current conditions\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- Current: 1070.80 | EMA20: 1088.82\n- RSI(7): 42.22 - neutral\n- MACD: -6.47 - negative\n- Below EMA20, weak structure\n- **Decision:** No position, not entering\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- Current: 2.41 | EMA20: 2.43\n- RSI(7): 32.39 - oversold\n- MACD: 0.015 - barely positive\n- Slight weakness but holding better than others\n- **Decision:** No position, not entering\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- Current: 0.191850 | EMA20: 0.195793\n- RSI(7): 29.10 - very oversold\n- MACD: 0.001 - near zero\n- Significant weakness\n- **Decision:** No position, not entering\n\n## Portfolio Risk Management\n- Current account value: $16,659.56\n- Available cash: $16,324.03\n- Single BTC position: ~30% of account in notional exposure\n- Return: +66.60% - strong performance\n- Sharpe: 10.24 - excellent risk-adjusted returns\n\nMarket showing broad weakness across all coins with oversold conditions. Holding BTC position as invalidation not triggered and stop-loss provides downside protection.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.046,\n      \"profit_target\": 109500.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 106800.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 107000 on 3-minute candle, indicating failed bounce and continuation of downtrend\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 333.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price is 1477 points below EMA20 (extended downside)\n2. MACD collapsing from 1087 to 280 (losing momentum fast)\n3. RSI at 30.867 shows oversold but could go lower\n4. We're only 502 points from invalidation\n5. Stop-loss at 106800 is 702 points away - reasonable protection\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- The invalidation condition has NOT been met yet (price still above 107000)\n- RSI oversold suggests potential bounce\n- But momentum is strongly negative\n- Position size: 0.046 BTC (~$4945 notional, 15x leverage)\n- Small unrealized loss of $32.76\n\n**Decision: HOLD**\nThe invalidation condition explicitly requires a \"close below 107000\" which hasn't occurred. Current price 107502 > 107000. The oversold RSI suggests we might see a bounce from these levels. The stop-loss at 106800 provides adequate protection. I will hold and let the position play out according to its risk parameters.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE: All showing similar bearish patterns with RSI in oversold/near-oversold territory.

The bearish momentum is accelerating (MACD getting more negative), and we're very close to the stop-loss. However, I must follow the rules: the invalidation condition is clear and hasn't been triggered yet. I will HOLD but remain vigilant.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- ETH: RSI 26.2, MACD -44.2, price 3,803 below EMA 3,907 - oversold but still falling\n- SOL: RSI 17.1 (extremely oversold), MACD -1.8, price 180 vs EMA 186.4 - severe weakness\n- BNB: RSI 44.5 (neutral), MACD -11.6, showing some stability\n- XRP: RSI 18.9 (extremely oversold), MACD -0.008, price 2.36 vs EMA 2.42\n- DOGE: RSI 25.3 (oversold), MACD -0.002, price 0.1898 vs EMA 0.1949\n\nAll altcoins showing extreme weakness. While oversold conditions could suggest bounce potential, the broad market weakness suggests waiting for confirmation of reversal before entering new positions.

The stop-loss at 106800 provides adequate protection.

Price is just $211 away from the profit target of 109500. The recent surge from 108377 to 109289 shows strong buying pressure. RSI at 65 indicates room for more upside without being overbought. MACD is improving (less negative). \n\nHowever, I'm concerned about:\n1. We're very close to the profit target (0.19% away)\n2. The position has been open for 20 minutes and is showing good profit\n3. Risk management suggests taking profits when targets are near\n4. The strong recent move could lead to a pullback\n\n**DECISION: CLOSE POSITION** - Taking profits as we're extremely close to the profit target. The $49.45 profit represents a solid gain, and the proximity to the target (only $211 away) makes this a prudent exit point for risk management.\n\n### Other Coins Analysis\n\n**ETH**: No position. Price 3879.10 below EMA20 3903.10. MACD negative (-48.451). RSI recovering to 64.111 but still in downtrend context. Not entering.\n\n**SOL**: No position. Price 187.39 above EMA20 186.50. Strong RSI at 69.173. MACD improving to -1.948. Interesting but already have BTC exposure. Not entering to avoid overexposure.\n\n**BNB**: No position. Price 1108.70 well above EMA20 1090.14. Very strong RSI at 79.186 (overbought). MACD improving. Too overbought for entry. Not entering.\n\n**XRP**: No position. Price 2.41 below EMA20 2.42. MACD negative. RSI at 58.180. Weak setup. Not entering.\n\n**DOGE**: No position. Price 0.193860 below EMA20 0.194756. MACD negative. RSI at 63.512. Not compelling.

Price remains above EMA20, MACD is positive and improving, and we're close to the profit target. The position has clear stop-loss protection at $183.50. Will let the trade run to either hit profit target at $195.50 or get stopped out. The risk/reward favors holding given proximity to target.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment:\n\n**BTC:** RSI 70.2 (overbought), MACD negative but improving. Price above EMA20. No position, not entering at overbought levels.\n\n**ETH:** RSI 48.5 (neutral), MACD negative (-29.4), price below EMA20 (bearish). Weak setup, avoiding.\n\n**BNB:** RSI 68.7 (approaching overbought), MACD positive (+5.3), price above EMA20. Momentum building but late to enter.\n\n**XRP:** RSI 43.4 (neutral-weak), MACD negative, price below EMA20. Downtrend, no entry.\n\n**DOGE:** RSI 58.7 (neutral), MACD near zero, price at EMA20. Consolidating, no clear edge.\n\n**Conclusion:** Only maintaining SOL position. No new entries warranted given market conditions and existing profitable position approaching target.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 60.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 183.50,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below EMA20 ($187.47) and MACD turns negative, or if price breaks below $183.50\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, the RSI levels are dangerously high. At RSI 85, we're at extreme overbought territory where reversals commonly occur. \n\nGiven:\n1. We're up +$243 (2.21% gain on 15x = ~33% ROI on margin)\n2. Profit target at $195.50 is only $3.41 away (1.8%)\n3. RSI at 85 suggests high probability of pullback\n4. Strong risk/reward to take profits near these levels\n\n**Risk Management Consideration:**\nWhile technically the invalidation isn't met, RSI 85+ is a major warning sign. However, I should respect my exit plan unless invalidation is triggered. The position remains valid per the stated conditions.\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- BTC: RSI 84.6 (overbought), strong momentum, no position\n- ETH: RSI 83.3 (overbought), recovering, no position  \n- BNB: RSI 59.6 (neutral), no position\n- XRP: RSI 76.7 (overbought), no position\n- DOGE: RSI 74.3 (overbought), no position\n\nAll major coins showing overbought conditions. Not ideal entry points for new positions given extended RSI readings across the board.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nHOLD SOL - Invalidation conditions not met. Price above EMA20, MACD positive, stop-loss not hit. While RSI is extremely overbought, I should stick to my exit plan and let the position run to profit target ($195.50) or stop-loss ($183.50).\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 60.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 183.50,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below EMA20 ($187.77) and MACD turns negative, or if price breaks below $183.50\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Profit target at $195.50 is very close (only $2.54 away). The technical setup remains bullish:\n- Momentum is strong (RSI 68)\n- MACD recovering toward positive territory\n- Price maintaining above EMA20 support\n- Recent price action shows strength ($189.29 \u2192 $192.96 bounce)\n\nGiven we're only 1.3% away from profit target and all technical indicators remain favorable, I should **HOLD** this position to capture the full profit target. The invalidation conditions are not met, and the risk/reward favors staying in.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n### BTC\n- Price: $110,659, above EMA20 ($110,346.85)\n- MACD improving: -354.154 (from -428.209)\n- RSI: 58.761 (neutral-bullish)\n- Strong recovery momentum but already have SOL exposure\n- **No action**: Managing existing position\n\n### ETH\n- Price: $3,927.20, above EMA20 ($3,915.40)\n- MACD improving: -27.142 (from -31.853)\n- RSI: 60.085 (neutral-bullish)\n- Similar setup to SOL but prefer to focus on current position\n- **No action**: Risk management - one position sufficient\n\n### BNB\n- Price: $1,108.70, barely above EMA20 ($1,106.94)\n- MACD: +4.627 (positive but declining from 6.351)\n- RSI: 42.136 (weak, showing selling pressure)\n- Recent drop from $1,124.80 to $1,103.40\n- **No action**: Weak momentum, unclear direction\n\n### XRP\n- Price: $2.50, well above EMA20 ($2.44)\n- MACD improving: -0.007 (nearly positive)\n- RSI: 90.673 (EXTREMELY overbought - danger zone)\n- Strong rally but RSI >90 suggests imminent pullback\n- **No action**: Too overbought, high reversal risk\n\n### DOGE\n- Price: $0.1966, at EMA20 ($0.196119)\n- MACD: -0.001 (nearly neutral)\n- RSI: 60.526 (neutral)\n- Choppy price action, no clear trend\n- **No action**: Insufficient conviction\n\n## Portfolio & Risk Management\n- Current account value: $17,012.66\n- Available cash: $15,945.26\n- SOL position notional: $11,577.60\n- Single position concentration is appropriate\n- Sharpe ratio: 9.124 (excellent risk-adjusted returns)\n- Total return: 70.13% (strong performance)\n\n**Conclusion**: HOLD SOL position. Profit target is very close, invalidation conditions are not met, and technical momentum remains favorable. No new positions warranted given strong existing exposure and proximity to profit target.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 60.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 183.50,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below EMA20 ($190.17) and MACD turns more negative, or if price breaks below $183.50\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The position was predicated on EMA20 support holding.\n2. **Current EMA20:** $0.19528 vs current price $0.1949 - price is now BELOW EMA20, which suggests the support has been breached\n3. **RSI (7-period):** 27.751 - extremely oversold, indicating strong selling pressure\n4. **RSI (14-period):** 42.024 - weak momentum\n5. **MACD:** Declining to 0.001, showing weakening bullish momentum\n6. **Price action:** Recent candles show: 0.19726 \u2192 0.19643 \u2192 0.1949, a clear downtrend\n7. **Stop-loss proximity:** Current price $0.1949 is only $0.0029 away from stop-loss at $0.192 (1.5% buffer)\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe invalidation condition states \"If price closes below 0.1920 (EMA20 support breach)\". While price hasn't closed below $0.1920 yet, it HAS breached below the EMA20 ($0.19528), which was the support level mentioned in the invalidation. The price is trading below EMA20 with extremely oversold RSI (27.75), suggesting continued downward pressure. Given:\n- Price below EMA20 (support breach)\n- Extremely oversold RSI indicating selling pressure\n- Very close to stop-loss ($0.192)\n- Negative P&L of -$103.55\n- Declining MACD momentum\n\nThe technical setup has deteriorated. While I could wait for a close below $0.1920 to strictly honor the invalidation, the spirit of the condition (EMA20 support breach) has been met. However, the extremely oversold RSI could lead to a bounce.

However, RSI at 83.6 (7-period) and 76.4 (14-period) indicates severe overbought conditions. This level of RSI typically precedes a pullback. \n\nGiven:\n1. Strong unrealized profit (+$210)\n2. Extreme overbought RSI (83.6)\n3. Profit target only 2.3% away\n4. Risk of giving back gains on imminent correction\n\nI should **CLOSE** the position to lock in profits. While the invalidation condition isn't technically met, the extreme overbought RSI represents a tactical risk management decision. Better to take the 2.8% gain now than risk a sharp reversal that could hit our stop-loss.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC: RSI 89.2 - Extremely overbought, no position (good)\n- ETH: RSI 89.0 - Extremely overbought, no position (good)  \n- SOL: RSI 86.0 - Extremely overbought, no position (good)\n- BNB: RSI 80.0 - Overbought, no position (good)\n- XRP: RSI 84.6 - Extremely overbought, no position (good)\n\nAll major coins showing extreme overbought conditions. This is NOT the time to enter new positions. The market needs to cool off.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 38800.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.2075,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.192,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.1920 (EMA20 support breach) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 511.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Taking profits at +2.8% gain due to extreme overbought RSI (83.6 on 7-period, 76.4 on 14-period) indicating imminent pullback risk.

Will continue monitoring for any break below $2.58 EMA20 support.\n\n## Other Market Opportunities\n\n### BTC Analysis\n- Price: $115,377, Strong uptrend\n- RSI(7): 84.6 (very overbought)\n- MACD: 1056.623 (extremely strong momentum)\n- Above EMA20: $112,961.92\n- **Decision**: Too overbought at current levels, risk of pullback is high\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- Price: $4,162.80\n- RSI(7): 65.832 (cooling from overbought)\n- MACD: 59.340 (positive)\n- Above EMA20: $4,042.50\n- **Decision**: Momentum cooling, not compelling entry\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- Price: $200.17\n- RSI(7): 51.257 (neutral)\n- MACD: 2.436 (positive but weak)\n- Above EMA20: $196.77\n- **Decision**: Neutral momentum, no clear setup\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- Price: $1,180.00\n- RSI(7): 93.078 (extremely overbought)\n- MACD: 9.377 (strong positive)\n- Above EMA20: $1,133.36\n- **Decision**: Too extended, high risk of reversal\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- Price: $0.203140\n- RSI(7): 47.737 (neutral/weak)\n- MACD: 0.002 (weak positive)\n- Above EMA20: $0.200462\n- **Decision**: Weak momentum, losing steam from earlier rally\n\n**Portfolio Risk Assessment**:\n- Current exposure: $8,663.49 in XRP (50% of account value)\n- Available cash: $16,665.32\n- Account performing well with 72.79% return and Sharpe ratio of 7.971\n- Risk management: Single position allows focus, no need to add risk in overbought market conditions\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 3300.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.75,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.52,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.52 (EMA20 support) or RSI(7) drops below 40 indicating trend reversal\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 990.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

While RSI is elevated at 74, it's not at extreme levels (was 94+ earlier). Price remains well above all support levels and the invalidation condition has NOT been triggered. The uptrend remains intact with positive MACD and rising EMA20. The profit target at $2.75 is reasonable given current momentum.\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n- Position is +5.75% in profit\n- Stop-loss provides 5.3% downside protection\n- Liquidation price at $2.439 provides adequate buffer\n- No signs of bearish reversal yet\n\n**Other markets review:**\n- BTC: Strong rally to $114,992, RSI cooling from overbought (65.9)\n- ETH: Strong at $4,173, RSI 69 - both showing healthy momentum\n- SOL, BNB, DOGE: Mixed signals, no compelling setups\n- Overall market sentiment: Bullish across major coins\n\n**Conclusion:** HOLD XRP position.

It dropped from 77.155 to 43.860 to 41.996 in the last three candles - a sharp momentum decline. While technically still above 40, the trend is clearly bearish and approaching invalidation.\n\nLooking at the broader picture:\n- RSI(14): 52.907 - neutral territory, down from 74.110\n- MACD: 0.030 - declining from 0.034, losing momentum\n- Price action: Failed to hold gains, dropping from highs of $2.67\n- Volume: 3.92M vs average 5.88M - below average, suggesting weak conviction\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nGiven that RSI(7) is at 41.996 (just 2 points above invalidation at 40) and showing clear downward momentum, the prudent risk management decision is to CLOSE this position. The invalidation condition is essentially being tested, and with RSI dropping rapidly, waiting for it to breach 40 could result in a worse exit. The position is slightly profitable (+$50.80), and protecting capital is paramount.\n\n**Other Coins Assessment:**\n- BTC: RSI(7) at 30.199 - oversold but showing sharp decline from 94.873. Price dropped from $115,566 to $113,903. Not entering a falling knife.\n- ETH: RSI(7) at 31.908 - similar oversold pattern, dropped from $4,206 to $4,093. Too risky.\n- SOL: RSI(7) at 62.230 - neutral, but recent volatility concerning. No clear setup.\n- BNB: RSI(7) at 39.738 - weak momentum after spike to $1,180, now at $1,137. Not attractive.\n- DOGE: RSI(7) at 23.695 - extremely oversold, but price below EMA20.

However, with existing SOL position being closed, I need to be selective about new entries.\n\n**ETH:** Showing weakness - RSI 34.74 (oversold), price 4096 just above EMA20 4083.76, MACD declining. Not ideal entry.\n\n**BNB:** Neutral - RSI 43.02, price near EMA20. No clear edge.\n\n**XRP:** Consolidating around 2.64, RSI 45.86. No strong signal.\n\n**DOGE:** Weak - RSI 28.97 (very oversold), price below EMA20. Bearish.\n\n**Conclusion:** Close SOL position to preserve capital.

MACD indicators are collapsing across the board, showing strong bearish momentum.\n\n### Individual Coin Analysis\n\n**BTC (112864):**\n- Price well below EMA20 (113692)\n- RSI(7) at 19.456 = extremely oversold\n- MACD declining rapidly from 892 to 452\n- Volume spike: 12606 vs avg 4689 (bearish volume)\n- Price dropped from 115377 to 112864 (-2.2%)\n- This level of oversold could trigger bounce, but momentum is strongly bearish\n\n**ETH (3978):**\n- Price below EMA20 (4072) by 2.3%\n- RSI(7) at 11.565 = MOST oversold of all coins\n- MACD collapsing from 55 to 18.8\n- Volume spike: 158821 vs avg 74910 (heavy selling)\n- Down from 4194 to 3978 (-5.2%)\n- Extreme oversold suggests potential bounce candidate\n\n**SOL (194.24):**\n- Below EMA20 (198.06) by 1.9%\n- RSI(7) at 17.724 = extremely oversold\n- MACD near zero (0.526)\n- Volume spike: 1.56M vs avg 632K\n- Relatively stable compared to others\n\n**BNB (1102.30):**\n- Below EMA20 (1131) by 2.5%\n- RSI(7) at 12.382 = second most oversold\n- MACD collapsed from 10.8 to 0.816\n- Sharp drop from 1180 to 1102 (-6.6%)\n- Heaviest percentage decline\n\n**XRP (2.60):**\n- Below EMA20 (2.63) by 1.1%\n- RSI(7) at 21.015 = oversold but less extreme\n- MACD weak but stable\n- Smallest deviation from EMA\n\n**DOGE (0.19356):**\n- Below EMA20 (0.19956) by 3.0%\n- RSI(7) at 7.266 = MOST EXTREME oversold reading\n- MACD turned negative\n- Volume spike: 94.7M vs avg 22.2M\n- Down from 0.203 to 0.194 (-4.8%)\n\n### Trading Strategy Decision\n\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions across ALL coins, this appears to be a capitulation event or flash crash scenario. However, the bearish momentum is still strong (declining MACDs, prices below EMAs).\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Trying to catch a falling knife is dangerous\n- BUT RSI readings below 20 (especially DOGE at 7.27 and ETH at 11.57) historically have high bounce probability\n- Volume spikes suggest panic selling may be exhausting\n\n**Best Opportunity:** ETH and DOGE show the most extreme oversold conditions with RSI(7) at 11.565 and 7.266 respectively. These are rare readings that typically precede short-term bounces.\n\n**Trade Selection:** I'll enter a LONG position on ETH as it has:\n1. Most liquid market (high volume)\n2. Second-most oversold RSI reading\n3. Clear support zone around 3950-4000\n4. Better risk/reward than DOGE (less volatile, more institutional)\n\nI'll use conservative position sizing (1% risk) and tight stop-loss given the strong bearish momentum. The invalidation will be if price breaks below the recent low with continued bearish momentum.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 4100.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3920.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3950 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 10\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 870.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

While MACD momentum is declining, the price held above the invalidation level of $3,950 and is attempting to push toward the profit target at $4,100. The position is slightly profitable and neither stop-loss nor profit target has been hit. Invalidation conditions are NOT met.\n\n**Conclusion:** HOLD ETH position. The setup remains valid, and we're positioned well to capture the move to $4,100 if momentum continues. The stop-loss at $3,920 provides adequate downside protection.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC, SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE: No positions. Market showing mixed signals with declining momentum across most assets. Not entering new trades at this time to preserve capital and focus on managing existing position.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 4100.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3920.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3950 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 10\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 870.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

BTC and ETH are showing EXTREME RSI readings (16.118 and 13.637 respectively on 7-period RSI), which historically precede sharp reversals. The volume spikes across all coins indicate capitulation selling.\n\n**Key observations favoring LONG entries:**\n1. RSI readings below 20 on major coins (BTC, ETH) are rare and typically mark short-term bottoms\n2. All coins have broken below their EMA20, creating potential mean reversion opportunities\n3. Volume spikes suggest panic selling exhaustion\n4. MACD deeply negative but may be forming a bottom\n\n**Strategy:**\nI will enter LONG positions on BTC and ETH (the most oversold) with tight stop-losses below recent lows. These are counter-trend scalp trades targeting a bounce back toward EMA20 levels.\n\n**Risk Management:**\n- Position sizing: ~$1,500-2,000 risk per trade\n- Tight stop-losses below recent swing lows\n- Profit targets at EMA20 reversion levels\n- Invalidation: Further breakdown below recent lows indicates continued downtrend\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.15,\n      \"profit_target\": 113350.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 109500.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $109,500 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1763.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 4.2,\n      \"profit_target\": 4047.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3850.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,850 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1638.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The extreme RSI reading (13.152) suggests capitulation selling, which could mean a bounce is imminent. However, the MACD momentum is severely negative. Given we're down only $94 on this position and the extreme oversold conditions, there's potential for mean reversion.\n- **Decision: HOLD** - Invalidation not met, extreme oversold may lead to bounce, risk/reward favorable at current levels.\n\n**ETH Position Review:**\n- Entry: $3,903.30 | Current: $3,902 | Unrealized P&L: -$13.66\n- Stop-loss: $3,850 | Profit target: $4,047\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below $3,850 on 3-minute candle\"\n- Current price $3,902 is ABOVE stop-loss $3,850 by $52 \u2713\n- Technical indicators are bearish but oversold:\n  - RSI(7): 13.487 (deeply oversold - matching BTC's extreme)\n  - RSI(14): 20.793 (oversold)\n  - MACD: -42.487 (negative momentum)\n  - Price below EMA20 ($4,032.45) by $130\n  - Recent decline from $4,111.80 to $3,902 (-5.1%)\n- Analysis: Similar to BTC, showing extreme oversold conditions. Only $13.66 loss on this position. The RSI(7) at 13.487 is at panic levels. While bearish momentum continues, we're not at invalidation yet and the extreme oversold reading suggests potential for a relief bounce.\n- **Decision: HOLD** - Invalidation not met, extreme oversold conditions, minimal loss, watching for mean reversion.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**SOL:** No position. Current price $193.99, RSI(7) 38.638, MACD -1.258. Below EMA20 but showing some stabilization with RSI recovering from extreme lows (was 15.846). Not entering - prefer to see clearer reversal signal.\n\n**BNB:** No position. Current price $1,107.20, RSI(7) 41.918, MACD -7.183. Showing slight recovery in RSI but still below EMA20. Not entering - weak momentum.\n\n**XRP:** No position. Current price $2.55, RSI(7) 16.840 (extremely oversold), MACD -0.007. Sharp decline with extreme oversold reading. While tempting due to oversold conditions, prefer to manage existing positions first.\n\n**DOGE:** No position. Current price $0.192270, RSI(7) 36.784, MACD -0.003. Below EMA20, showing weakness.

      "raw_response": "# CHAIN OF THOUGHT\n\n## Current Market Analysis\n\n**Market Context:** We're seeing significant weakness across all major crypto assets. BTC down to 109,784 from recent highs, ETH at 3,880, both showing oversold conditions but continued bearish momentum.\n\n## Position-by-Position Review\n\n### BTC Position Analysis\n- **Entry:** 110,675 | **Current:** 109,784 | **P&L:** -$141.95 (-0.8%)\n- **Stop-Loss:** 109,500 | **Profit Target:** 113,350\n- **Invalidation Condition:** \"If price closes below $109,500 on 3-minute candle\"\n- **Technical Analysis:**\n  - RSI (7): 26.9 - deeply oversold\n  - RSI (14): 27.4 - oversold territory\n  - MACD: -1247.86 - strongly negative and worsening\n  - Price vs EMA20: 109,784 vs 112,640 - significantly below (2.5% gap)\n  - Price action: Just bounced from 109,784 low after touching it\n  \n- **Critical Assessment:** Current price 109,784 is ABOVE stop-loss of 109,500 by only $284. However, we need to check if any 3-minute candle has CLOSED below 109,500. Looking at the recent price series: [110,102, 110,833, 111,430, 109,784]. The current price is 109,784, but this appears to be the latest reading, not necessarily a close. The invalidation condition requires a CLOSE below 109,500.\n\n- **Decision Rationale:** The position is dangerously close to stop-loss and the market shows continued weakness (MACD deteriorating, price well below EMA). However, RSI at 26.9 suggests we're in oversold territory where a bounce is possible. Since we haven't definitively closed below 109,500 yet, and we're in extreme oversold territory, I'll hold but monitor very closely. If the next candle closes below 109,500, we must exit.\n\n### ETH Position Analysis\n- **Entry:** 3,903.30 | **Current:** 3,880.70 | **P&L:** -$103.12 (-0.6%)\n- **Stop-Loss:** 3,850 | **Profit Target:** 4,047\n- **Invalidation Condition:** \"If price closes below $3,850 on 3-minute candle\"\n- **Technical Analysis:**\n  - RSI (7): 21.8 - deeply oversold\n  - RSI (14): 22.9 - oversold\n  - MACD: -72.49 - strongly negative and worsening\n  - Price vs EMA20: 3,880.70 vs 4,017.79 - 3.4% below\n  - Price action: Recent prices [3,902, 3,933.40, 3,938.90, 3,880.70] showing downward pressure\n  \n- **Critical Assessment:** Current price 3,880.70 is ABOVE stop-loss of 3,850 by $30.70 (0.8% buffer). The invalidation condition requires a close below 3,850. We haven't hit that yet, but we're getting close.\n\n- **Decision Rationale:** ETH is showing similar weakness to BTC but with slightly more cushion to the stop-loss. RSI at 21.8 is extremely oversold, suggesting potential for a bounce. The MACD continues to deteriorate, but at these RSI levels, we're often near short-term bottoms. Will hold as invalidation condition not yet met, but this is on thin ice.\n\n### Other Coins (SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE)\n- **No positions held** - Will not include in output\n- All showing oversold conditions but in confirmed downtrends\n- Not entering new positions given current market weakness and existing exposure\n\n## Risk Management Assessment\n- Current drawdown on open positions: -$245 combined\n- Account value: $15,933.50\n- Both positions at risk but not yet invalidated\n- Sharpe ratio of 5.838 indicates historically strong performance\n- Portfolio is 59.34% up overall - protecting capital is priority\n\n## Final Decision\nBoth positions remain VALID (invalidation conditions not met) but are under significant pressure. Given extreme oversold readings (RSI 26.9 BTC, 21.8 ETH), there's potential for a bounce. However, if either closes below their stop-loss levels on this or the next candle, we must exit immediately.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.15,\n      \"profit_target\": 113350.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 109500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $109,500 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1763.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 4.2,\n      \"profit_target\": 4047.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3850.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,850 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1638.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Cash available: $15,174.34\n\n## Trading Decision Rationale\n\nThis is a classic oversold bounce setup across the entire crypto market. All major coins are showing:\n1. RSI(7) below 20 (extreme oversold)\n2. RSI(14) below 25 (oversold)\n3. Heavy selling volume suggesting capitulation\n4. Prices well below EMAs\n\nHowever, the momentum is still strongly bearish with accelerating MACD divergence. This could be:\n- A capitulation bottom with imminent bounce\n- OR continuation of a larger breakdown\n\n**Risk Assessment**: With 82 invocations over 46 minutes, we're likely in the final stages of the trading period. Given the extreme oversold conditions, I'll take selective LONG positions on the most oversold assets (ETH and DOGE) with tight stop-losses, anticipating a technical bounce.\n\n**Position Sizing**: With $15,174 available and strong performance (51.74% return, Sharpe 4.67), I'll risk 3-4% per position ($450-600) on mean-reversion plays.\n\n**Entry Strategy**:\n- **ETH**: RSI(7) at 10.28 is extreme - targeting 15x leverage for bounce to 3,850-3,900\n- **DOGE**: RSI(7) at 10.70, massive volume spike - targeting 15x leverage for bounce to 0.186-0.190\n\nStop-losses will be tight (2-3% below entry) given the strong downtrend.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.2,\n      \"profit_target\": 3900.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3690.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3690 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 8\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 35000,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.190,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.175,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.175 on 3-minute candle or fails to bounce within 3 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 450.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

This suggests:\n1. Panic selling/capitulation phase\n2. Potential for violent bounce, but timing is uncertain\n3. Could continue lower before reversal\n\n**Strategy:** Given the extreme oversold conditions across ALL assets, I should:\n1. Close the DOGE position due to invalidation\n2. Wait for signs of stabilization before entering new positions\n3. Extreme RSI readings can stay extreme longer than expected in leveraged markets\n4. Need to see price action stabilize and turn before entering\n\n**No new positions at this time** - waiting for market to show signs of bottoming rather than trying to catch a falling knife.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 35000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.19,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.175,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.175 on 3-minute candle or fails to bounce within 3 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 450.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation condition met - price closed below $0.175 stop-loss level.
