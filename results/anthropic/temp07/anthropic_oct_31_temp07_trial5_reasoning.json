This is the beginning of my trading session, so I need to evaluate whether current market conditions present good entry opportunities.\n\n### Market-Wide Assessment\n\nAll major cryptocurrencies are showing severe oversold conditions with extremely bearish technical indicators:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $105,589 vs EMA20: $110,350 (-4.3% below)\n- RSI(7): 17.8 (extreme oversold - below 20)\n- RSI(14): 22.3 (oversold)\n- MACD: -1,386 (deeply negative and accelerating downward)\n- Price action: Sharp drop from $111,268 to $105,589 (-5.1%) in just 30 minutes\n- Below both 20-EMA and 50-EMA (bearish structure)\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,756 vs EMA20: $3,986 (-5.8% below)\n- RSI(7): 20.6 (extreme oversold)\n- RSI(14): 25.5 (oversold)\n- MACD: -68.5 (deeply negative)\n- Price dropped from $4,061 to $3,756 (-7.5%) in 30 minutes\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $177.65 vs EMA20: $193.22 (-8.1% below)\n- RSI(7): 16.4 (extreme oversold - most oversold of all)\n- RSI(14): 21.5 (oversold)\n- MACD: -5.3 (negative)\n- Price dropped from $196.80 to $177.65 (-9.7%)\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,062.60 vs EMA20: $1,174.19 (-9.5% below)\n- RSI(7): 9.5 (EXTREMELY oversold - critical level)\n- RSI(14): 14.7 (extremely oversold)\n- MACD: -35.0 (deeply negative)\n- Worst RSI reading of all coins\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.24 vs EMA20: $2.41 (-7.1% below)\n- RSI(7): 17.4 (extreme oversold)\n- RSI(14): 21.1 (oversold)\n- MACD: -0.059 (negative)\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.17849 vs EMA20: $0.19555 (-8.7% below)\n- RSI(7): 14.8 (extreme oversold)\n- RSI(14): 19.2 (extreme oversold)\n- MACD: -0.005 (negative)\n\n### Trading Decision\n\n**Situation:** We're witnessing a market-wide flash crash or severe correction. All assets are deeply oversold with RSI(7) readings between 9.5 and 20.6 - these are panic selling levels.\n\n**Strategy Considerations:**\n\n1. **Oversold Bounce Opportunity:** When RSI(7) drops below 20 across the board, we often see technical bounces as oversold conditions get relieved.\n\n2. **Risk Assessment:** However, extreme oversold doesn't mean the bottom is in. Price can remain oversold for extended periods during strong downtrends. The bearish momentum is severe (all MACD deeply negative, all prices well below EMAs).\n\n3. **Leverage Risk:** In such volatile conditions with -5% to -10% moves in 30 minutes, using high leverage (15-20x) is extremely dangerous. A small continuation could liquidate positions quickly.\n\n**Decision:** I will enter ONE position on BNB as it shows the most extreme oversold condition (RSI 9.5) which historically leads to mean reversion bounces. I'll use conservative leverage (10x) and tight risk management given the volatility.\n\n**Why BNB:**\n- RSI(7) at 9.5 is the most extreme reading\n- Statistical mean reversion probability is highest\n- Volume is present (12,150 vs average 19,024)\n- Will risk only $500 (5.6% of capital)\n\n**Why NOT the others:**\n- Too risky to enter multiple positions simultaneously in a crash\n- Need to preserve capital for better setups\n- Will wait to see if bounce materializes before adding exposure\n\n## Position Sizing & Risk Management\n\nFor BNB long position:\n- Risk: $500 (5.6% of capital)\n- Leverage: 10x\n- Entry: $1,062.60\n- Stop-loss: $1,037 (-2.4% = -24% with 10x leverage, ~$500 loss)\n- Profit target: $1,100 (+3.5% = +35% with 10x leverage, ~$875 gain)\n- Position size: $500 \u00d7 10 = $5,000 notional / $1,062.60 = 4.7 BNB\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 4.7,\n      \"profit_target\": 1100.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1037.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,037 on 3-minute candle, indicating continuation of downtrend rather than oversold bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The position is slightly profitable (+$40.27). However, I'm concerned about:\n1. The RSI at 18.184 is EXTREMELY oversold - even more oversold than at entry\n2. The bounce has been minimal (+0.86%)\n3. Price is still well below the EMA20 and in a strong downtrend\n4. The last candle shows price at $1,071.70, which is still $28.30 away from profit target\n\nGiven that:\n- Invalidation NOT met (price above $1,037)\n- Stop-loss NOT hit (price above $1,037)\n- Small profit exists but not at target\n- Extremely oversold conditions persist (RSI 18.184)\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - The invalidation condition is clear and has not been triggered. The position is working as planned with a small profit. The extreme oversold reading suggests potential for the bounce to continue toward the $1,100 profit target.\n\n**Other Coins:**\nAll other coins (BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE) show similar extreme oversold conditions (RSI 7-period all below 36), but I already have exposure through BNB. Given my -9.92% drawdown and limited capital ($8,464 available), I should not add new positions.

The price is holding above $1,037. However, the MACD remains deeply negative and the downtrend is strong. The recent bounce from $1,062.60 to $1,074 suggests some buying interest at these oversold levels.\n\nGiven:\n1. Invalidation NOT triggered (price above $1,037)\n2. Small profit (+$51)\n3. Extremely oversold RSI suggesting potential bounce\n4. Position is within risk parameters\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - The invalidation condition has not been met, and the extremely oversold conditions suggest a potential bounce toward the profit target of $1,100.\n\n### Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC**: Price $106,821, RSI 39.583 (oversold), MACD deeply negative (-1,257). Strong downtrend from $111,288. Not entering - downtrend too strong.\n\n**ETH**: Price $3,797.30, RSI 33.917 (oversold), MACD -49.574. Down from $4,012.90. Oversold but downtrend intact. Not entering.\n\n**SOL**: Price $182.74, RSI 41.565, MACD -3.878. Down from $193.49. Showing some recovery but below EMA20. Not entering.\n\n**XRP**: Price $2.30, RSI 42.797, MACD -0.044. Recovering from $2.24 low. Slightly better momentum but still weak. Not entering.\n\n**DOGE**: Price $0.18475, RSI 42.470, MACD -0.004. Similar pattern to XRP. Not compelling enough. Not entering.\n\n**Risk Management**: With account value at $9,020 and one position at $5,047 notional (56% of account), maintaining current exposure is appropriate. Not adding new positions in this volatile downtrend environment.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 4.7,\n      \"profit_target\": 1100.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1037.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,037 on 3-minute candle, indicating continuation of downtrend rather than oversold bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

All coins trading below their EMA20s with negative MACD readings, indicating strong downtrends.\n\n## Position Review\n\n**BNB Position Analysis:**\n- Entry: $1,062.60 (4.7 units, 10x leverage)\n- Current: $1,066.10 (+$13.95 unrealized PnL)\n- Stop-loss: $1,037.00\n- Profit target: $1,100.00\n- Invalidation: \"If price closes below $1,037 on 3-minute candle\"\n\n**Technical Assessment:**\n- Current price: $1,066.10 (above entry by $3.50)\n- RSI (7-period): 17.93 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI (14-period): 19.05 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- MACD: -33.538 (worsening, was -30.894 last candle)\n- Price vs EMA20: $1,066.10 vs $1,140.88 (-$74.78, -6.6%)\n- Recent price action: Brief bounce from $1,062.60 low to $1,074, now retreating to $1,066.10\n\n**Critical Concern:** \nThe invalidation condition states \"closes below $1,037\" but I need to evaluate if the bounce thesis is still valid:\n- The RSI at 17.93 is in extreme oversold territory (typically <20 signals bounce potential)\n- However, MACD continues to deteriorate (-33.538 vs -30.894)\n- Price is still $29 above stop-loss, giving room\n- The bounce from $1,062.60 to $1,074 showed some buying interest, but momentum fading\n- Current candle at $1,066.10 shows weakness returning\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Distance to stop-loss: $29.10 (2.7%)\n- Distance to invalidation: $29.10 (same as stop-loss)\n- The position is barely profitable (+$13.95)\n- Market structure remains bearish (all EMAs declining, negative MACD)\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nWhile RSI is extremely oversold (suggesting potential bounce), the technical structure is deteriorating:\n1. MACD getting more negative (-33.538)\n2. Price unable to sustain bounce above $1,074\n3. All timeframes showing bearish momentum\n4. The invalidation condition hasn't been met YET (not below $1,037)\n5. But the bounce thesis is weakening - price should be rallying harder from such oversold RSI\n\nGiven that:\n- The invalidation condition is NOT technically met (price is at $1,066, not below $1,037)\n- RSI is at extreme oversold levels (17.93)\n- Stop-loss provides reasonable protection\n- Small profit exists (+$13.95)\n\n**DECISION: HOLD** - The invalidation condition has not been met. Price remains above $1,037. The extreme RSI oversold reading (17.93) still supports potential bounce thesis. Will let stop-loss at $1,037 protect the position.\n\n## Other Opportunities\n\n**BTC:** $106,421 - RSI 35.34, heavily oversold but not extreme. Below EMA20 ($109,277). Downtrend intact. No entry.\n\n**ETH:** $3,825.70 - RSI 43.71, below EMA20 ($3,933). Showing slight recovery but still weak. No entry.\n\n**SOL:** $181.93 - RSI 38.37, below EMA20 ($190.13). Weak structure. No entry.\n\n**XRP:** $2.30 - RSI 41.39, below EMA20 ($2.38). Consolidating but no clear setup. No entry.\n\n**DOGE:** $0.18427 - RSI 40.76, below EMA20 ($0.19219). Weak momentum. No entry.\n\n**Conclusion:** Market-wide selling pressure. No new entries warranted. BNB position remains valid as invalidation condition not met and extreme oversold RSI supports potential bounce.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 4.7,\n      \"profit_target\": 1100.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1037.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,037 on 3-minute candle, indicating continuation of downtrend rather than oversold bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price has NOT closed below $1,037 (invalidation not met)\n2. Stop-loss at $1,037 has not been hit\n3. Position is slightly profitable (+$35.10)\n4. RSI at 25.059 suggests potential oversold bounce (original thesis)\n5. The recent recovery from $1,062.60 to $1,070.60 shows some buying interest\n\nHowever, concerning factors:\n- MACD deeply negative (-33.560) shows strong bearish momentum\n- Price significantly below EMA20 ($1,133.20)\n- Overall market weakness across all coins\n- Low volume (3,141 vs avg 14,196)\n\n**Conclusion:** HOLD the position. The invalidation condition has NOT been met, stop-loss is intact, and the extreme oversold RSI levels suggest the bounce thesis could still play out. The position is small (+$35 profit) but the risk/reward remains favorable toward the $1,100 target.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE: All showing bearish technicals with prices below EMAs, negative MACD, and oversold RSI. However, given my current -9.98% drawdown and existing BNB position, I will not open new positions. Risk management dictates waiting for clearer reversal signals or better entry points.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 4.7,\n      \"profit_target\": 1100.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1037.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,037 on 3-minute candle, indicating continuation of downtrend rather than oversold bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.62,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

All assets are recovering from oversold conditions\n2. Volume is very low across the board (lack of conviction)\n3. All prices remain below their EMA20 (bearish structure)\n4. MACD values are negative but improving\n\n**Best Setup:** ETH shows the strongest recovery momentum with RSI(7) at 56.9 and improving MACD. However, price is still below EMA20 and volume is weak.\n\n**Risk Management:** With my poor performance, I should wait for clearer confirmation of trend reversal rather than trying to catch falling knives. All assets need to reclaim their EMA20 levels with strong volume before entering.\n\n**Decision:** WAIT - No trades. Market structure is still bearish (all below EMA20), volume is weak, and we just had a flash crash. Better to preserve capital and wait for confirmed reversal signals.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

Current price is 185.81, which is $1.31 above the stop-loss. While technically the invalidation hasn't been triggered yet, we are dangerously close. The price dropped sharply in the most recent candle from 186.90 to 185.81, showing bearish momentum.\n\nHowever, looking at the exact wording: the position should be closed \"if price closes below 184.50\". The current candle close is at 185.81, which is ABOVE 184.50. The invalidation condition has NOT been met yet.\n\n**Risk Considerations**:\n- Only $1.31 buffer to stop-loss\n- 15x leverage means high risk\n- Already down $70 on this position\n- Account is down -8.75% overall\n- Price momentum turning bearish (RSI declining, below EMA)\n\n**Decision**: Given that:\n1. The invalidation condition (close below 184.50) has NOT technically been met\n2. Current price is 185.81, still above 184.50\n3. But we're very close to the stop-loss with deteriorating technicals\n4. Risk management suggests protecting capital\n\nI will **CLOSE** this position as a risk management decision. While the strict invalidation hasn't triggered, we're too close to the stop-loss with bearish momentum building. Better to take a small loss than risk a larger one with 15x leverage.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC**: Price 106,726, well below EMA20 (107,771), RSI 36.17 (oversold), MACD negative and improving. Downtrend but showing signs of bottoming. However, already have one losing position - not adding risk.\n\n**ETH**: Price 3,886, near EMA20 (3,896.85), RSI 51.63 (neutral), MACD improving. Consolidating but no clear setup.\n\n**BNB**: Price 1,083.90, well below EMA20 (1,110.92), RSI 35.47 (oversold), strong downtrend. Too risky.\n\n**XRP**: Price 2.35, at EMA20, RSI 45.27 (neutral), MACD near zero. Sideways consolidation, no edge.\n\n**DOGE**: Price 0.18869, slightly below EMA20, RSI 50.62 (neutral). Neutral, no clear opportunity.\n\n**Conclusion**: Close SOL position for risk management. No new positions warranted given current market conditions and account drawdown.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 40.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 193.5,\n      \"stop_loss\": 184.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 184.50 (below recent swing low) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - price at 185.81 is only $1.31 above stop-loss of 184.5 with bearish momentum building.

Price below $106,500? NO - currently at $108,435 \u2713\n2. RSI(7) below 40? NO - currently at 78.897 \u2713\n3. Invalidation condition NOT met \u2713\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nBTC showing strong momentum with RSI(7) at 78.9. Price has moved +$700 from entry and is approaching the profit target of $109,800 (only $1,365 away). The invalidation conditions are not met - price is well above $106,500 and RSI(7) is extremely strong. MACD is improving (less negative), suggesting momentum shift toward bullish. \n\nHowever, RSI(7) at 78.9 indicates overbought conditions and potential for pullback. Given we're only $1,365 from profit target and showing strong momentum, I'll HOLD to capture the full profit target. Stop loss at $106,400 provides adequate protection.\n\n**Decision: HOLD** - Conditions remain bullish, no invalidation triggered, approaching profit target.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**ETH:** No position. RSI(7) at 84.561 (extremely overbought), price at $3,977 above EMA20 ($3,913). Strong momentum but stretched. With BTC position already leveraged 15x and taking up 74.5% of account value, adding ETH would over-concentrate risk. PASS.\n\n**SOL:** No position. RSI(7) at 79.759 (overbought), price at $190.67 above EMA20 ($187.69). Similar to ETH - strong but overbought. Portfolio already concentrated in BTC. PASS.\n\n**BNB:** No position. RSI(7) at 73.311, price at $1,118.50 above EMA20 ($1,110.28). Decent momentum but not compelling enough to add new position with existing BTC exposure. PASS.\n\n**XRP:** No position. RSI(7) at 74.174, price at $2.40 above EMA20 ($2.36). Moderate momentum but lower conviction. PASS.\n\n**DOGE:** No position. RSI(7) at 85.112 (most overbought of all). Price at $0.19644 above EMA20 ($0.19077). Extremely stretched, high risk of pullback. PASS.\n\n**Risk Management Conclusion:**\nWith 74.5% of account already in BTC at 15x leverage, adding any new positions would create dangerous over-concentration. All altcoins showing overbought RSI(7) readings (73-85), suggesting pullback risk. Better to manage existing BTC position to profit target than add stretched entries.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.063,\n      \"profit_target\": 109800.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 106400.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $106,500 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 40 indicating momentum reversal\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 450.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

RSI(7) at 83.6 indicates extreme overbought conditions - high risk of pullback\n2. Price has moved rapidly (+$2,115 in 9 minutes) suggesting exhaustion potential\n3. Profit target is close ($959 away) but RSI this high rarely sustains\n4. Invalidation condition NOT met (price above $106,500, RSI above 40)\n5. However, with RSI > 80, the probability of a sharp reversal increases significantly\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe position is in profit and invalidation conditions are NOT met. However, RSI(7) at 83.6 is dangerously overbought. This typically precedes a pullback. Given:\n- We're only $959 from profit target\n- RSI indicates unsustainable momentum\n- We've been trading for only 8 minutes (early in session)\n- Risk/reward is unfavorable here (small potential gain vs. larger pullback risk)\n\nI will **HOLD** the position as invalidation conditions are not met, but I'm monitoring closely. The technical setup suggests we may hit the profit target soon, but a reversal is also likely.\n\n**Other Coins (ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE):**\n- ETH: RSI(7) 86.2 - extremely overbought, not entering\n- DOGE: RSI(7) 86.2 - extremely overbought, not entering\n- SOL: RSI(7) 58.5 - neutral, but no clear setup\n- BNB: RSI(7) 69.4 - approaching overbought\n- XRP: RSI(7) 72.1 - overbought\n\nAll altcoins showing overbought conditions. No new positions warranted. Market appears overextended across the board.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.063,\n      \"profit_target\": 109800.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 106400.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $106,500 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 40 indicating momentum reversal\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 450.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Account value: $9,264.25 (down 7.36% from starting capital).\nSharpe ratio of -7.12 indicates poor risk-adjusted returns so far.

This is a classic late-stage rally scenario. The prudent approach is to wait for:\n1. A pullback to support levels\n2. RSI to cool below 60-65\n3. MACD to show healthy consolidation\n\nEntering now would be chasing momentum at the worst possible time. With account already down 7.36%, capital preservation is critical.\n\n## Final Decision\n**NO TRADES** - Market is too extended across the board. All major coins showing extreme overbought readings. Will wait for better entry opportunities with lower risk profiles. Better to miss a move than to catch the top of a parabolic rally.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{}\n```",

Still risky at current levels.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current price: $1,124.50\n- RSI(7): 67.3 - Neutral to slightly overbought\n- RSI(14): 61.0 - Neutral zone\n- MACD: -2.83 (still negative but improving)\n- Price vs EMA20: $1,124.50 vs $1,110.57 (+1.3% above)\n- **Assessment**: Most balanced technically but lagging the market rally.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current price: $2.47\n- RSI(7): 87.7 - Very overbought\n- RSI(14): 78.3 - Overbought\n- MACD: 0.022 (positive but small)\n- Price vs EMA20: $2.47 vs $2.38 (+3.8% above)\n- **Assessment**: Extended move, high risk of pullback.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current price: $0.201150\n- RSI(7): 86.1 - Very overbought\n- RSI(14): 80.2 - Overbought\n- MACD: 0.003 (positive)\n- Price vs EMA20: $0.201150 vs $0.192302 (+4.6% above)\n- **Assessment**: Strong rally but overbought conditions.\n\n## Risk Management Considerations\n\nGiven my -7.36% drawdown and terrible Sharpe ratio, I need to be extremely selective. The entire crypto market is showing overbought conditions with RSI(7) readings above 77 for all coins. This suggests a coordinated rally that's likely to see at least a short-term pullback.\n\n**Key concerns:**\n1. All coins showing overbought RSI readings\n2. Rapid 30-minute rallies across the board\n3. Already down 7.36% - need to preserve capital\n4. Parabolic moves rarely end well for late entries\n\n**Decision:** STAY IN CASH. This is a classic \"FOMO trap\" scenario. The rally is too extended, RSI readings are at dangerous levels, and entering now would be chasing momentum at the worst possible time. Better to wait for a pullback to more reasonable entry levels or clearer setups with better risk/reward.\n\nThe prudent strategy is to preserve capital and wait for:\n- RSI to cool off (below 70 on the 7-period)\n- A healthy pullback to support levels\n- MACD divergence or other reversal signals to play the other side\n- More favorable entry points with defined risk\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

Price remains above both the EMA20 (187.94) and the invalidation level (186.00). However, the position is underwater and showing weakness. The RSI at 37.96 suggests oversold conditions which could lead to a bounce. The stop-loss at 185.50 is close but hasn't been hit.\n\n**Decision: HOLD**\n- Invalidation condition NOT met (price still above 186.00)\n- Stop-loss not hit (185.50 vs current 188.77)\n- RSI oversold suggests potential bounce\n- Risk management: Position is monitored, will close if invalidation triggers\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** Strong uptrend, RSI 70.25 (overbought but sustainable), MACD 1055.25 (strong momentum). Price 110,753 above EMA20 108,753. However, already 11 minutes into trading with -9.29% returns - need to be selective. Not entering.\n\n**ETH:** Price 3980.40, showing weakness after peak at 4053.40. RSI 40.56 (neutral-bearish), declining from overbought. Not compelling entry.\n\n**BNB:** Price 1100.90, declining from 1127.90 high. RSI 32.17 (oversold), MACD declining. Weak momentum, not entering.\n\n**XRP:** Price 2.52, strong momentum with RSI 89.38 (extremely overbought). MACD 0.044 positive. Price above EMA20 (2.40). Too extended for entry - high risk of pullback.\n\n**DOGE:** Price 0.199530, RSI 66.69 (neutral-bullish), MACD 0.004 positive. Moderate strength but not compelling enough given current portfolio stress.\n\n**Portfolio Consideration:**\nWith account value at $9,070.94 (down 9.29%) and only one position, I need to manage risk carefully. The SOL position hasn't triggered invalidation, so I'll maintain it while monitoring closely.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 50.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 202.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 185.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 186.00 (EMA20 support breakdown) on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 665.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Recent price action shows a bounce from $187.77 to $189.64\n\n**Risk Management:**\n- Current drawdown: -1.29% is manageable\n- Stop-loss provides 3.5% protection from current price\n- Position is still within acceptable risk parameters\n- No signs of trend reversal, just healthy consolidation\n\n**Conclusion:** HOLD the SOL position. The invalidation condition has not been met, technical structure remains intact, and this appears to be a normal pullback within an uptrend rather than a breakdown.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** Strong uptrend (price $110,479 >> EMA20 $108,864), but RSI cooled to 58.7 from overbought. No position, not entering after such a strong move.\n\n**ETH:** Price $3,978 above EMA20 $3,946, but RSI dropped to 39.26 showing weakness. MACD declining. Not attractive for entry.\n\n**BNB:** Price $1,100.20 \u2248 EMA20 $1,100.54, RSI weak at 31.36. Losing momentum. No entry.\n\n**XRP:** Strong momentum, price $2.49 >> EMA20 $2.41, RSI 66.05, MACD positive. Tempting but already have SOL exposure.\n\n**DOGE:** Price $0.19995 >> EMA20 $0.19423, RSI 70.00, strong uptrend. Similar to XRP - good momentum but already allocated.\n\n**Portfolio Decision:** Maintain focus on existing SOL position rather than diversifying into new trades.

My portfolio is down -10.82% with a negative Sharpe ratio of -9.094, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. I need to be extremely selective and only enter high-probability setups.\n\n### Market Overview:\nAll major coins are showing significant weakness:\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current: $109,008 (below EMA20 of $108,874)\n- RSI(7): 26.889 - SEVERELY OVERSOLD\n- RSI(14): 45.497 - Neutral to weak\n- MACD: 1001.452 but declining from 1136\n- Price action: Sharp drop from $111,161 to $109,008 (-1.94%)\n- The RSI(7) at 26.889 suggests extreme oversold conditions and potential bounce\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $3,922.60 (below EMA20 of $3,944.83)\n- RSI(7): 20.020 - EXTREMELY OVERSOLD (critical level)\n- RSI(14): 37.839 - Oversold\n- MACD: 35.281, declining from 49.182\n- Sharp selloff from $4,053.40 to $3,922.60 (-3.23%)\n- RSI(7) at 20 is an extreme reading suggesting imminent bounce\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $185.46 (below EMA20 of $187.74)\n- RSI(7): 24.147 - SEVERELY OVERSOLD\n- RSI(14): 37.228 - Oversold\n- Drop from $192.93 to $185.46 (-3.87%)\n- Oversold but trend looks weak\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,081.30 (significantly below EMA20 of $1,099.32)\n- RSI(7): 16.018 - EXTREMELY OVERSOLD (critical extreme)\n- RSI(14): 32.759 - Oversold\n- Massive drop from $1,127.90 to $1,081.30 (-4.13%)\n- Most oversold of all coins\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.45 (above EMA20 of $2.41) - BULLISH DIVERGENCE\n- RSI(7): 45.061 - Neutral\n- RSI(14): 55.888 - Neutral\n- MACD: 0.045, still positive\n- Price holding above EMA20 while others are below\n- Relative strength compared to other coins\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.196520 (above EMA20 of $0.194510)\n- RSI(7): 33.772 - Oversold but not extreme\n- RSI(14): 51.902 - Neutral\n- Still above EMA20 showing relative strength\n\n### Trading Opportunity Assessment:\n\nThe market is showing extreme oversold conditions across the board. However, given my -10.82% drawdown, I need to be cautious and selective. The best opportunities appear to be:\n\n1. **BNB** - RSI(7) at 16.018 is the most extreme oversold reading, suggesting a high probability of mean reversion bounce\n2. **ETH** - RSI(7) at 20.020 is also critically oversold\n3. **XRP** - Showing relative strength by holding above EMA20 with neutral RSI\n\nGiven my risk management constraints and current drawdown, I'll enter ONE position in the most oversold asset with the highest probability of mean reversion: **BNB**.\n\n### Trade Setup for BNB:\n\n**Entry Rationale:**\n- RSI(7) at 16.018 is at extreme oversold levels (typically <20 signals bounce)\n- RSI(14) at 32.759 confirms oversold condition\n- Price $1,081.30 vs EMA20 $1,099.32 = -1.64% deviation\n- MACD still positive at 5.756\n- Risk/reward favorable for mean reversion play\n\n**Position Sizing:**\n- Available: $8,917.50\n- Risk per trade: 2% of account = $178.35\n- Using 15x leverage for moderate exposure\n- Entry: $1,081.30\n- Stop-loss: $1,065.00 (1.51% below entry, below recent low)\n- Profit target: $1,110.00 (2.65% above entry, near EMA20 resistance)\n- Position size: ($8,917.50 \u00d7 0.20) / $1,081.30 = 1.65 BNB\n\n**Invalidation Condition:** If price closes below $1,065 on 3-minute candle (indicates continued breakdown rather than bounce)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.65,\n      \"profit_target\": 1110.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1065.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,065 on 3-minute candle, indicating failed bounce and continued breakdown\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 178.35\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The invalidation condition has NOT been met yet - price hasn't closed below $1,065\n2. Extreme oversold conditions (RSI 11.736) suggest potential bounce\n3. Price is only $6.30 from stop-loss, very tight margin\n4. Already down $17.39 on this position\n5. Risk management suggests we should respect our stop-loss levels\n\n**Decision:** The invalidation condition states \"closes below $1,065\" - the current price is $1,071.30, which is still above this level. However, we're extremely close to the stop-loss. Given the extreme oversold RSI (11.736), there's potential for a bounce, but the bearish momentum (negative MACD, price below EMA) is concerning.\n\n**HOLD** - The invalidation condition has not technically been met yet (price hasn't closed below $1,065). The extreme oversold RSI suggests we might see a bounce soon.

The RSI shows overbought conditions and this could easily retrace.\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- Current: $4,082.90 (similar massive spike from $3,890)\n- RSI(7): 78.1 (overbought)\n- RSI(14): 70.6 (overbought)\n- MACD: 21.24 (positive momentum)\n- Price above EMA20 ($3,954.66)\n- Volume: 231,760 vs avg 81,485 (2.8x surge)\n- Pattern: Strong V-shaped recovery\n\n**Similar concern**: Parabolic move that could retrace quickly.\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- Current: $196.14 (spike from $186.17)\n- RSI(7): 79.5 (overbought)\n- RSI(14): 70.5 (overbought)\n- MACD: 0.823 (positive)\n- Volume: 1,452,713 vs avg 527,924 (2.8x surge)\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- Current: $2.52 (recovery from $2.43)\n- RSI(7): 72.7 (approaching overbought)\n- RSI(14): 68.0 (healthy momentum)\n- MACD: 0.027 (positive)\n- Volume: 12,979,067 vs avg 5,051,749 (2.6x surge)\n- Price above EMA20 ($2.43)\n\n**Most attractive setup**: Less extreme RSI than others, still in strong uptrend, good volume confirmation.\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- Current: $0.20424 (spike from $0.19443)\n- RSI(7): 77.5 (overbought)\n- RSI(14): 71.9 (overbought)\n- Volume surge present\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- Current: $1,111.50 (recovery from $1,076)\n- RSI(7): 68.3 (healthiest RSI of all coins)\n- RSI(14): 58.5 (neutral/bullish)\n- MACD: -2.844 (still negative - weakest momentum)\n- Less convincing setup\n\n## Trading Decision\n\nGiven my significant drawdown (-10.35%) and poor Sharpe ratio, I need to be very selective. The market is showing a coordinated breakout across all coins with massive volume, suggesting a legitimate move rather than a fake-out.\n\n**Risk Assessment**: All coins are overbought on short timeframes after parabolic moves. However, the volume surge and coordinated breakout suggest institutional buying.\n\n**Best Opportunity**: XRP shows the most balanced setup - strong momentum but not as extremely overbought as others. RSI(7) at 72.7 vs 78-80 for others gives more room to run.\n\n**Strategy**: Take ONE position in XRP with conservative sizing given the drawdown. Use tight stop-loss below recent support at $2.43 to protect capital. Target the next resistance level.\n\n**Position Sizing**: With $8,964 available and current drawdown, I'll risk only $180 (2% of account) with 15x leverage for a controlled position.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1070,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.65,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.42,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.42 on 3-minute candle, indicating failed breakout\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 180\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Current price is $2.4924, which is ~2.9% above the stop-loss level. The recent candles show:\n- Low of $2.43 (above stop-loss)\n- Current recovery to $2.49\n- No 3-minute candle close below $2.42\n\nThe position is experiencing normal volatility within acceptable parameters. RSI shows room for upside (not overbought), MACD remains positive, and price is trending above the EMA20. The recent spike to $2.52 shows the upside potential is still intact.\n\n**Risk Management:**\n- Position size: $2,667 notional (~30% of account)\n- Leverage: 15x (manageable for XRP volatility)\n- Stop-loss provides ~3% downside protection from current price\n- Risk/reward remains favorable with profit target at $2.65 (+6.3% from current)\n\n**Conclusion:** HOLD - Invalidation condition has NOT been met. Price remains above stop-loss with bullish technical indicators. No reason to exit prematurely.\n\n**Other Coins:**\n- BTC: Strong momentum (RSI 60.6, above EMA20), but already have XRP position - not adding new positions\n- ETH: Neutral (RSI 53.4), consolidating - no compelling setup\n- SOL: Bullish (RSI 65.7), but respecting no pyramiding rule\n- BNB: Weak (RSI 46.1, below EMA20, negative MACD) - avoid\n- DOGE: Moderate (RSI 61.5), but no clear edge\n\nNot entering any new positions to maintain focused risk management with existing XRP trade.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1070.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.65,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.42,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $2.42 on 3-minute candle, indicating failed breakout\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 180.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The position remains above stop-loss with adequate cushion, and RSI is well above the 25 critical level. The small profit suggests the trade is working as intended. With 15x leverage, I need to respect the exit plan and not exit prematurely based on temporary weakness. The oversold RSI(7) at 33.44 suggests potential for a bounce back toward the profit target at $3,920.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC, SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE:** No positions, no entries planned\n- Markets showing mixed signals with RSI values in oversold territory\n- Available cash: $8,257.25 (already 95% deployed in ETH position)\n- Risk management: Should not overextend with existing leveraged position\n- No compelling setups that meet my high-conviction criteria\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.18,\n      \"profit_target\": 3920.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3780.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $3,780 or if RSI(7) drops below 25 without bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, several factors make me cautious:\n\n1. **Strong Downtrend**: All coins below EMA20, negative MACD across the board\n2. **No Reversal Signals Yet**: No bullish divergence, no MACD crossovers\n3. **Portfolio Performance**: Down -12.5% with poor Sharpe ratio suggests my recent strategy hasn't been working\n4. **Risk Management**: With only $8,750 left, I need to be selective\n\n**Strategy**: I'll take ONE calculated position in SOL, which shows the most extreme oversold condition (RSI 17.1). This is a mean reversion play with tight risk management. The extreme reading suggests a bounce is likely, but I'll use conservative leverage and tight stops.\n\nI'm avoiding:\n- **BTC/ETH**: Too much capital required even with leverage for proper position sizing\n- **XRP**: While oversold, less liquid and more volatile\n- **DOGE**: Meme coin with unpredictable behavior\n- **BNB**: Not oversold enough to justify entry\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 24,\n      \"profit_target\": 186.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 176.50,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If RSI(7) drops below 15 or price closes below $176.50 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued breakdown rather than bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 504.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The recent lows at $180.17 and $180.00 clearly triggered the exit condition.\n\nAdditionally:\n- RSI at 71+ suggests overbought conditions and potential reversal risk\n- 12x leverage on a position that already violated its invalidation is too risky\n- Account is down -10.63%, need to preserve capital\n- The bounce could be a dead-cat bounce or bull trap\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION**\nReason: Invalidation condition was met (price closed below $182.00), and despite recovery, risk management dictates respecting predetermined exit rules.

Price remains well above $1,085 and above the rising EMA20. The technical setup remains bullish with positive MACD momentum and strong RSI. While RSI is elevated at 73.868, it's not extreme enough to warrant an exit, especially with MACD showing strong positive momentum. The position is slightly profitable and the trend structure is intact.\n\n**Other Coins Assessment:**\n- **BTC**: RSI 76.561 (overbought), but strong momentum. Price above EMA20. Could enter but already have BNB exposure.\n- **ETH**: RSI 68.677, price above EMA20, MACD improving. Decent setup but weaker than BTC/SOL.\n- **SOL**: RSI 80.326 (very overbought), but explosive momentum. Price well above EMA20. Strong but extended.\n- **XRP**: RSI 56.452, price below EMA20, MACD negative. Weak setup.\n- **DOGE**: RSI 63.018, price slightly above EMA20, MACD barely negative. Neutral setup.\n\nGiven I'm down -10.68% on the account, I need to be selective. My BNB position is working and invalidation is not met. I'll hold it and not add new positions given the elevated RSI levels across the board and risk management considerations.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.106,\n      \"profit_target\": 1180.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1070.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,085 on 3-minute candle (EMA20 breakdown)\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 800.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Current price is $1,124.90 and EMA20 is $1,099.48. Price has NOT closed below $1,085, and price remains well above EMA20. **Invalidation condition NOT met.**\n\n**Decision on BNB:** HOLD - The position remains valid. While showing small unrealized loss, the technical structure is intact with price above EMA20, positive MACD momentum, and RSI cooling from overbought levels which is healthy. The recent pullback from $1,134.90 to $1,124.90 is normal profit-taking. Stop-loss at $1,070 provides adequate protection.\n\n## Market Overview for Other Coins\n\n**BTC:** \n- Price: $111,072 | RSI(7): 84.56 - Extremely overbought\n- Strong uptrend but RSI at dangerous overbought levels (>80)\n- MACD: 347.2 - Very strong momentum\n- Risk: Too extended for new entry, likely to see pullback\n\n**ETH:**\n- Price: $3,950.10 | RSI(7): 83.27 - Extremely overbought  \n- MACD: -6.595 - Still slightly negative despite price rally\n- Bearish divergence potential (price up, MACD weak)\n- Risk: Overbought with weak momentum confirmation\n\n**SOL:**\n- Price: $192.09 | RSI(7): 84.99 - Extremely overbought\n- Strong rally from $180 to $192 (+6.6%)\n- MACD: 1.354 - Positive but momentum may be exhausting\n- Risk: Most overbought of all coins\n\n**XRP:**\n- Price: $2.44 | RSI(7): 76.65 - Overbought but less extreme\n- MACD: -0.010 - Nearly neutral, slight negative\n- Consolidating range with modest uptrend\n- Opportunity: Less extended than others\n\n**DOGE:**\n- Price: $0.19659 | RSI(7): 74.31 - Moderately overbought\n- MACD: Near zero - Weak momentum\n- Below 50-period EMA on longer timeframe\n- Risk: Weakest momentum structure\n\n## Risk Management Assessment\n\nCurrent account value: $8,930.89 (down 10.69%)\nAvailable cash: $8,923.55\nOpen position exposure: ~$119 (very small)\n\nThe portfolio is highly liquid with only one small position. However, given the extreme overbought conditions across ALL major coins (RSI >74 on every single asset), this is NOT the time to add new positions. The market is screaming for a pullback.\n\n**Strategy:** Hold the BNB position as it's still valid and has room to run to $1,180 target. Avoid new entries until RSI levels cool below 70 on the 7-period timeframe.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.106,\n      \"profit_target\": 1180.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1070.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,085 on 3-minute candle (EMA20 breakdown)\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.78,\n      \"risk_usd\": 800.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price would need to close below $1,085, but we're at $1,124.80 with EMA20 support at $1,100.54. The position remains valid.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Position is slightly underwater (-$0.62) but within normal variance\n- Stop-loss at $1,070 provides 4.87% downside protection from current price\n- Profit target at $1,180 offers 4.91% upside potential\n- Technical structure supports continuation: MACD rising, price above EMA20, RSI not overbought\n\n**Decision: HOLD**\nThe position remains technically sound. No invalidation conditions met, price above key support levels, and momentum indicators suggest potential for continuation toward profit target. The consolidation pattern could resolve upward given the positive MACD and rising EMA20.\n\n## Other Coins - No Action\n\n**BTC, ETH, SOL:** All showing extreme overbought conditions (RSI 85+, 81+, 83+ respectively). While momentum is strong, entering at these levels carries high reversal risk. Better to wait for pullbacks.\n\n**XRP, DOGE:** Showing strength but RSI levels (81.8, 78.6) also elevated.

While RSI is elevated at 71.30, it's not at extreme levels (previously hit 85.32). The invalidation condition has not been triggered, and the position maintains a healthy distance from the stop-loss.

No position, not entering at these levels.\n- **ETH**: MACD still negative (-6.40), consolidating. No clear setup.\n- **BNB**: RSI dropped to 41.87, showing weakness. MACD positive but fading. No setup.\n- **XRP**: RSI 92.38 - extremely overbought, dangerous entry point. Avoid.\n- **DOGE**: MACD negative, below longer-term EMA.

The invalidation condition ($188.00) has NOT been triggered - current price is $193.40, which is $5.40 above the invalidation level. Technical indicators show:\n- Strong uptrend (price > EMA20 by ~$4)\n- Positive MACD momentum\n- RSI elevated but not dangerously overbought (70 range)\n- No bearish reversal signals\n\nThe stop-loss at $188.50 provides adequate protection, and we're only $6.60 away from our $200 profit target. Given the positive momentum and intact invalidation condition, I should HOLD this position.\n\n**Other Coins Assessment:**\n- **BTC**: Strong momentum (RSI 67.9, MACD 720), price at $111,057 above EMA20 at $109,803. However, we're down -10.68% overall and need to be selective. BTC is extended.\n- **ETH**: Consolidating around $3,921, RSI 54.4 (neutral), MACD positive but weak at 17.5. Not compelling.\n- **BNB**: RSI 56.4 (neutral), MACD declining from 18.4 to 13.9. Losing momentum.\n- **XRP**: RSI 95.5 (extremely overbought), parabolic move. Too risky to enter here.\n- **DOGE**: RSI 69.7, similar pattern to XRP but less extreme. Not entering.\n\nGiven our negative portfolio performance (-10.68%), I should focus on managing the existing SOL position rather than adding new risk. No new positions warranted.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 13.8,\n      \"profit_target\": 200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 188.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 188.00 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 178.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price has not closed below $188.00. Current price is $191.76, which is $3.76 above the invalidation level. However, the momentum has turned bearish with RSI dropping sharply from overbought to 40.72.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Stop-loss at $188.50 provides $3.26 cushion from current price\n- Position is down only -0.68%, well within acceptable range\n- 15x leverage means liquidation at $180.096 - still safe distance\n- RSI showing oversold conditions on 7-period (40.72) suggests potential bounce\n- But the rapid decline in RSI is concerning\n\n**Decision: HOLD**\nThe invalidation condition has NOT been met (price has not closed below $188.00). While momentum has weakened, the technical setup remains intact. Price is still above EMA20, MACD is positive, and we're not near stop-loss. The RSI at 40.72 suggests we may be approaching oversold territory where a bounce could occur. Will continue monitoring closely.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n\n**BTC:** Strong uptrend, price $111,396 well above EMA20 ($110,148). RSI 63.66 healthy. MACD positive at 936. No position, but market looks strong. Not entering due to already having SOL exposure.\n\n**ETH:** Price $3,933 above EMA20 ($3,896). RSI 57.47 neutral. MACD positive. Stable uptrend but no compelling entry signal.\n\n**BNB:** Price $1,108 slightly above EMA20 ($1,105). RSI 38.96 showing weakness. MACD declining. Not attractive for entry.\n\n**XRP:** EXTREME overbought - RSI 98.3! Price $2.60 in parabolic move. MACD positive but this is dangerously overbought. Would not enter here - high risk of reversal.\n\n**DOGE:** Price $0.196 slightly above EMA20 ($0.195). RSI 37.04 weak. Recent decline. Not compelling.\n\n**Portfolio Status:**\n- Down -10.92% overall\n- $8,749 cash available\n- Single position in SOL with 15x leverage\n- Sharpe ratio -6.237 indicates poor risk-adjusted returns\n\nGiven the portfolio is down and we have one position showing weakness but not invalidated, I will hold SOL and not add new positions to avoid overexposure.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 13.8,\n      \"profit_target\": 200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 188.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 188.00 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 178.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Not at profit target ($200.00) - need $7.09 more upside\n2. Not at stop-loss ($188.50) - $4.41 away\n3. Invalidation condition NOT triggered - price well above $188.00\n4. Technical indicators show consolidation but no bearish breakdown\n5. Price above EMA20, MACD still positive\n\n**Conclusion:** HOLD - No exit conditions met, position remains valid\n\n## Market Overview for Other Coins:\n\n**BTC:** Strong uptrend, RSI cooling from overbought (44.9), price above EMA. No position, but sharp pullback from $111,683 to $111,271.\n\n**ETH:** Similar pattern, RSI(7) at 43.9 after being overbought, retracing from highs. Price still above EMA20.\n\n**BNB:** Consolidating, RSI neutral at 58.9, trending above EMA20.\n\n**XRP:** EXTREMELY overbought - RSI(7) at 85.8, RSI(14) at 88.8! Parabolic move from $2.48 to $2.60. High risk of reversal.\n\n**DOGE:** Weak - RSI(7) at 27.8 (oversold), price below EMA20, declining.\n\n**New Trade Opportunities:**\nGiven portfolio is down -10.75% and only have one small position, I should look for high-probability setups. However:\n- XRP is dangerously overbought (RSI 85+)\n- DOGE is weak and oversold but no clear reversal signal\n- BTC/ETH/BNB showing consolidation after recent strength\n\n**Risk Management:** With account at $8,925 (down from $10,000), I need to be selective. Current SOL position is small ($2,662 notional). Will hold SOL and wait for clearer setups.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 13.8,\n      \"profit_target\": 200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 188.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 188.00 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 178.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, I already have SOL exposure and don't want to over-leverage with 2 positions given current -10.62% drawdown.\n\n**ETH**: Price above EMA20, RSI 60.4 neutral. Similar reasoning - avoiding over-leverage.\n\n**XRP**: RSI at 90.99 - EXTREMELY overbought, dangerous entry point. Clear parabolic move that could reverse sharply.\n\n**BNB**: RSI 68 getting extended, modest momentum. Not compelling enough to add exposure.\n\n**DOGE**: RSI 52.9 neutral, but price action choppy. No clear setup.\n\nGiven portfolio down -10.62%, risk management dictates maintaining current single position rather than adding new leveraged exposure.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 13.8,\n      \"profit_target\": 200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 188.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 188.00 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 178.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, with RSI at extreme overbought levels (81.7), there's high risk of reversal. The profit target is only $2.22 away (1.1% move). Given:\n1. Extreme overbought conditions (RSI >80)\n2. Profit target nearly reached (98.9% of target achieved)\n3. Strong unrealized gains (+2.5%)\n4.

While momentum is strong, these levels typically precede corrections. With my current -10% account drawdown, risk management dictates taking profits on SOL rather than adding new high-risk positions at extreme levels.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 13.8,\n      \"profit_target\": 200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 188.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 188.00 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 178.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Taking profits near target - price at $197.78 vs target $200.00 (98.9% achieved) with extreme overbought RSI at 81.7 indicating high reversal risk\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price action shows strength with a recovery to $1,138, MACD momentum is accelerating, and RSI indicates continued bullish momentum without being dangerously overbought. The position is nearly equidistant from both stop-loss and profit target, suggesting we're in a good zone to let the trade work. No reason to exit prematurely.\n\n**DECISION: HOLD**\n\n## Market Overview for Other Coins\n\n### BTC Analysis\n- Extremely overbought: RSI(7) = 90.86, RSI(14) = 85.80\n- Strong momentum but potential exhaustion zone\n- Price $114,601 well above EMA20 $111,976\n- High volume (7,957 vs avg 3,863) suggests strong participation\n- **No position, not entering at these extreme levels**\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- Extremely overbought: RSI(7) = 91.98, RSI(14) = 86.92\n- Similar to BTC - very extended\n- Price $4,160 significantly above EMA20 $3,975\n- High volume confirms move but risks pullback\n- **No position, too extended to enter**\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- RSI(7) = 81.70, RSI(14) = 76.57 - Overbought but less extreme\n- Price $200.05 above EMA20 $194.69\n- **No position, market already extended**\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- RSI(7) = 70.17, RSI(14) = 75.88 - Moderately overbought\n- **No position, no compelling setup**\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- RSI(7) = 82.22, RSI(14) = 76.98 - Overbought\n- **No position, extended like others**\n\n**Overall Market Context**: All major coins are showing overbought conditions with RSI(7) readings above 70, many above 80-90. This suggests a broad market rally that may be nearing exhaustion. Not an ideal time to initiate new leveraged positions. Will maintain discipline and only hold existing BNB position which has defined risk parameters.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 7.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1165.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1110.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $1,110 on 3-minute candle or RSI(7) drops below 40 indicating momentum failure\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 680.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The price is only $8.30 away from hitting our target. However, the RSI(7) at 86.115 indicates extreme overbought conditions, which could lead to a pullback.

The stop-loss at $1,110 provides adequate protection if the market reverses.\n\n**Other Coins Analysis:**\n- **BTC**: RSI(7) at 94.481 - Dangerously overbought, but strong momentum. Not entering due to extreme overbought conditions.\n- **ETH**: RSI(7) at 92.441 - Also extremely overbought. Avoid new entry.\n- **SOL**: RSI(7) at 70.256 - More reasonable but already extended.

High risk of pullback after such a parabolic move. The slight decline in RSI while price remains elevated suggests momentum loss. **PASS** - too extended.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current: $4,162.80 | EMA20: $4,042.50 (2.98% above)\n- RSI(7): 65.8 (down sharply from 92.4 - significant cooling)\n- MACD: 59.34 (positive but weakening)\n- Price action: Rallied to $4,206, now retracing to $4,162\n- **Assessment:** RSI dropped from 92+ to 65.8 - major momentum loss. Price peaked and is now retracing. This suggests profit-taking after the rally. Risk of further pullback. **PASS** - momentum fading.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current: $200.17 | EMA20: $196.77 (1.73% above)\n- RSI(7): 51.3 (neutral, down from 90.9)\n- MACD: 2.436 (positive but plateauing)\n- Price action: Spiked to $204.39, now back to $200.17\n- **Assessment:** RSI crashed from 90.9 to 51.3 - severe momentum loss. Price rejected at $204 and falling. This is a clear reversal signal. **PASS** - bearish reversal.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current: $1,180 | EMA20: $1,133.36 (4.11% above)\n- RSI(7): 93.1 (extremely overbought)\n- MACD: 9.377 (accelerating upward)\n- Price action: Strong breakout from $1,116 to $1,180\n- **Assessment:** This is the strongest setup. RSI at 93 but MACD still accelerating. Price well above EMA20. Volume above average (6,554 vs 5,353). Unlike BTC/ETH, momentum hasn't cooled yet. However, RSI at 93 is dangerous - very little room before exhaustion. Given my negative portfolio performance, I need high-conviction trades. This is too risky at these levels. **PASS** - too extended despite strength.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current: $2.63 | EMA20: $2.58 (1.94% above)\n- RSI(7): 50.2 (neutral, down from 94.3)\n- MACD: 0.046 (positive but declining)\n- Price action: Consolidating around $2.63 after spike to $2.65\n- **Assessment:** RSI collapsed from 94 to 50 - major momentum loss. Price consolidating but momentum clearly fading. **PASS** - no edge.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current: $0.203140 | EMA20: $0.200462 (1.34% above)\n- RSI(7): 47.7 (neutral, down from 84.7)\n- MACD: 0.002 (weak positive)\n- Price action: Peaked at $0.2068, now at $0.2031\n- **Assessment:** RSI dropped from 84 to 47 - momentum gone. Price retracing. Weakest setup. **PASS** - no conviction.\n\n## Overall Market Assessment\nAll coins show similar pattern: extreme overbought conditions followed by RSI cooling and price stalling/retracing. This suggests the rally is exhausting across the board. The market is in a dangerous phase where early buyers are taking profits.\n\n## Risk Management Decision\nGiven:\n1. Portfolio already down -6.44%\n2. Negative Sharpe ratio showing poor risk-adjusted returns\n3. All coins showing momentum exhaustion after parabolic moves\n4. No clear high-probability setups with favorable risk/reward\n5. Better to preserve capital than force trades in exhausted conditions\n\n**DECISION: Stay in cash. Wait for better setups with confirmed momentum or pullback entries.**\n\nThe prudent approach is to wait for either:\n- A healthy pullback to support levels with momentum reset\n- A clear breakout with fresh momentum (not exhausted RSI)\n- Better risk/reward opportunities\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

The market is showing mixed signals:\n\n1. **BTC & ETH**: Both oversold (RSI<32) after strong rallies, but momentum is declining. Could bounce from oversold levels, but trend may be reversing. Too risky to enter here.\n\n2. **SOL**: Best relative strength, holding above EMA20 with healthy RSI. This is the only coin showing resilience. However, if BTC continues down, SOL will likely follow.\n\n3. **DOGE**: Deeply oversold (RSI 23.7) and below EMA20. Classic oversold bounce candidate, but also the weakest chart. High risk.\n\n4. **BNB & XRP**: Consolidating without clear direction. Not compelling setups.\n\n**Strategy**: With 37 minutes of trading and significant losses, I should wait for clearer signals rather than force trades. The market just experienced a pullback from overbought conditions. I'll wait for:\n- Confirmation of oversold bounce with RSI divergence\n- Clear support holding with volume\n- MACD turning positive\n\n**Decision**: No trades at this time. Preserve capital and wait for better risk/reward setups. The oversold conditions could lead to bounces, but without confirmation, entering now is catching a falling knife.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

The market shows mixed signals:\n- BTC is recovering but momentum is fading\n- Most altcoins are weak or at critical support levels\n- High volatility with no clear trend direction\n\n**Strategy:** Given the current drawdown and uncertain market conditions, I will wait for clearer setups. The best opportunity appears to be BTC if it can hold above $114,000 with confirmation, but I need to see more stability first. SOL is at support but could easily break down. \n\n**Risk Management:** With only $8,131 remaining from $10,000, I cannot afford another large loss. I will wait for high-probability setups with clear invalidation levels rather than forcing trades in choppy conditions.\n\n**Decision:** No trades at this time. Market is too uncertain and I need clearer momentum signals to justify risking capital given my current drawdown.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n{}",

My portfolio is down -19.67% with a poor Sharpe ratio of -7.141, indicating significant losses relative to risk taken. This requires careful analysis before entering new positions.\n\n### Market-Wide Selloff Analysis\n\n**ALL coins are showing severe technical weakness:**\n\n1. **BTC (112,864)**: \n   - RSI(7): 19.456 - EXTREMELY oversold\n   - RSI(14): 33.137 - Oversold\n   - Price below EMA20 (113,692)\n   - MACD declining sharply (452 from 935)\n   - Sharp drop from 115,377 to 112,864 (-2.2%)\n\n2. **ETH (3,978)**:\n   - RSI(7): 11.565 - CRITICALLY oversold (lowest I've seen)\n   - RSI(14): 26.655 - Very oversold\n   - Price below EMA20 (4,072)\n   - MACD collapsing (18.856 from 61.460)\n   - Drop from 4,194 to 3,978 (-5.2%)\n\n3. **SOL (194.24)**:\n   - RSI(7): 17.724 - Extremely oversold\n   - RSI(14): 30.917 - Oversold\n   - Price below EMA20 (198.06)\n   - MACD declining (0.526 from 1.834)\n\n4. **BNB (1,102.30)**:\n   - RSI(7): 12.382 - CRITICALLY oversold\n   - RSI(14): 25.888 - Very oversold\n   - Price below EMA20 (1,131)\n   - Massive drop from 1,180 to 1,102 (-6.6%)\n\n5. **XRP (2.60)**:\n   - RSI(7): 21.015 - Very oversold\n   - RSI(14): 34.127 - Oversold\n   - Price below EMA20 (2.63)\n\n6. **DOGE (0.19356)**:\n   - RSI(7): 7.266 - CATASTROPHICALLY oversold (extreme)\n   - RSI(14): 20.431 - Very oversold\n   - Price below EMA20 (0.19956)\n   - Drop from 0.20314 to 0.19356 (-4.7%)\n\n### Trading Decision\n\nThis is a coordinated market-wide selloff with ALL coins showing extreme oversold conditions. The RSI(7) readings are at panic levels (DOGE at 7.266, ETH at 11.565, BNB at 12.382). This suggests:\n\n1. **Mean reversion opportunity**: When RSI(7) drops below 20, we often see bounce-backs\n2. **High risk environment**: The sharp coordinated drop suggests macro selling pressure\n3. **Volume confirmation**: All coins showing elevated volume vs. averages\n\n**Strategy**: I will enter a SMALL mean-reversion position on the most oversold coin (DOGE) with tight risk management. Given my current drawdown (-19.67%), I must be conservative with position sizing.\n\n- **DOGE** has RSI(7) at 7.266 - historically extreme levels that typically bounce\n- Using 15x leverage to limit capital at risk\n- Tight stop-loss to protect against continued selling\n- Quick profit target for mean reversion bounce\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 31000,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.198500,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.191000,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.191000 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 20 within next 5 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The RSI has not only failed to recover above 20, but has deteriorated to extreme levels. With 15x leverage and proximity to stop-loss, the risk of further downside is too high. The proper risk management approach is to close the position per the invalidation rule.\n\n**Other Coins Assessment:**\n- **BTC**: RSI(7) 16.001 - extreme oversold, but sharp -2.2% drop, below EMA20\n- **ETH**: RSI(7) 23.917 - oversold, -4.2% decline, below EMA20\n- **SOL**: RSI(7) 16.824 - extreme oversold, -3.1% decline\n- **BNB**: RSI(7) 15.992 - extreme oversold, -3.5% decline\n- **XRP**: RSI(7) 29.076 - oversold, -1.9% decline\n\nAll major coins are showing extreme selling pressure with RSI(7) readings in the teens or low 20s. This is a broad market selloff. While these conditions can precede reversals, entering new positions in such volatile conditions with high leverage would be imprudent without confirmation of a bottom.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 31000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.1985,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.191,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.191000 or RSI(7) fails to recover above 20 within next 5 candles\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation condition met - RSI(7) failed to recover above 20 within specified timeframe and has deteriorated to extreme capitulation levels (6.467).

Current price is $196.76, so technically the invalidation has NOT been triggered yet. However, we are dangerously close.\n\n**Decision: CLOSE POSITION**\n- Reason: While the invalidation condition hasn't technically been met (no close below $195), the position is extremely close to stop-loss with only 0.89% buffer\n- Price is struggling below EMA20 ($198.02) \n- With 15x leverage, risk of liquidation at $185.584 is concerning\n- Better to take small loss (-1.05%) than risk hitting stop-loss or worse\n- Market showing weakness across major coins (BTC RSI 21.45, ETH RSI 19.70)\n\n## Market Overview for Other Coins\n\n**BTC**: RSI 21.45 (oversold), MACD -273.78 (deeply negative), price $111,510 well below EMA20 $113,567. Strong downtrend.\n\n**ETH**: RSI 19.70 (extremely oversold), MACD -22.625, price $3,949.50 below EMA20 $4,058. Severe selling pressure.\n\n**BNB**: RSI 24.73 (oversold), MACD -8.05, price $1,098.90 below EMA20 $1,125.90. Downtrend.\n\n**XRP**: RSI 45.00 (neutral), MACD -0.004 (near zero), price $2.62 close to EMA20 $2.63. Most stable.\n\n**DOGE**: RSI 20.29 (oversold), MACD -0.002, price $0.1910 below EMA20 $0.1981. Weak.\n\n**Market Conclusion**: Broad market weakness. Not favorable for new long entries. Portfolio at -20.45% return needs defensive positioning.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 20.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 204.5,\n      \"stop_loss\": 195.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below $195.00 on 3-minute candle, indicating failed breakout above EMA20\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 400.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - price at $196.76 only 0.89% above stop-loss with 15x leverage.

I need to carefully evaluate whether current market conditions present good entry opportunities.\n\n### Market Overview:\n**All major coins are showing bearish momentum:**\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Price: $110,675 (down from $114,170 in last 30 minutes)\n- Below EMA20 ($113,349) - bearish\n- RSI(7): 16.1 - EXTREMELY oversold\n- RSI(14): 22.3 - severely oversold\n- MACD: -542.5 - strong bearish momentum\n- Volume: 19,763 vs avg 5,889 - HIGH volume on decline (3.35x)\n- Price dropped ~3% in 30 minutes\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Price: $3,903 (down from $4,116)\n- Below EMA20 ($4,047) - bearish\n- RSI(7): 13.6 - EXTREMELY oversold (most oversold of all coins)\n- RSI(14): 20.9 - severely oversold\n- MACD: -37.2 - strong bearish momentum\n- Volume: 293,984 vs avg 97,748 - HIGH volume (3x average)\n- Price dropped ~5.2% in 30 minutes\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Price: $192.75 (down from $202.32)\n- Below EMA20 ($197.74) - bearish\n- RSI(7): 28.3 - oversold but not extreme\n- RSI(14): 33.1 - oversold\n- MACD: -1.235 - bearish\n- Volume: 3,017,569 vs avg 819,572 - VERY HIGH (3.68x)\n- Price dropped ~4.7% in 30 minutes\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Price: $1,106.70 (down from $1,131.40)\n- Below EMA20 ($1,123.85) - bearish\n- RSI(7): 40.8 - approaching oversold\n- RSI(14): 38.2 - neutral/oversold\n- MACD: -8.239 - bearish\n- Volume elevated but less extreme\n\n**XRP & DOGE:**\n- Both showing weakness but less dramatic moves\n- XRP RSI(7): 26.0 - oversold\n- DOGE RSI(7): 45.3 - neutral\n\n### Trading Decision:\n\n**EXTREMELY OVERSOLD CONDITIONS = POTENTIAL BOUNCE OPPORTUNITY**\n\nThe market is experiencing a sharp selloff with:\n1. BTC and ETH showing RSI(7) below 17 - historically extreme oversold levels\n2. High volume on the decline suggests panic selling\n3. All coins below their EMA20 with negative MACD\n4. This represents a potential capitulation/washout scenario\n\n**Strategy: Look for mean reversion bounce on most oversold assets**\n\nGiven my -20.44% drawdown, I need to be selective. I'll focus on:\n- **ETH**: Most oversold (RSI 13.6), high volume, clear support opportunity\n- **BTC**: RSI 16.1, extremely oversold, high volume\n\nI'll use conservative position sizing given the bearish momentum and my current drawdown. Risk management is critical here.\n\n**Position Sizing:**\n- Risk 2% of account ($159) per trade\n- Use 15x leverage for better risk/reward\n- Tight stop-losses below recent lows\n- Quick profit targets on bounce (3-5%)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.6,\n      \"profit_target\": 4050.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3875.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price breaks below $3,875 or RSI(7) fails to bounce above 25 within next 15 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 160.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.0014,\n      \"profit_target\": 113500.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 109500.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price breaks below $109,500 or fails to reclaim $112,000 within next 15 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 155.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

RSI(7) is at 13.487, which is BELOW 25 and has NOT bounced above 25. The invalidation condition explicitly states \"RSI(7) fails to bounce above 25 within next 15 minutes\" - we are well past 15 minutes (44 minutes into trading, 78 invocations). The RSI has remained suppressed and is now at extreme oversold levels. Additionally, price is dangerously close to stop-loss at $3,875 (only $27 buffer).\n\n**DECISION**: **CLOSE** - Invalidation condition MET. RSI(7) failed to bounce above 25, and the downtrend is accelerating with MACD deteriorating rapidly.\n\n### BTC Position Analysis\n- **Entry**: $110,675 | **Current**: $110,102 | **PnL**: -$0.88\n- **Stop-Loss**: $109,500 | **Profit Target**: $113,500\n- **Invalidation Condition**: \"If price breaks below $109,500 or fails to reclaim $112,000 within next 15 minutes\"\n- **Current Technical State**:\n  - RSI(7): 13.152 (extreme oversold)\n  - RSI(14): 19.760 (extreme oversold)\n  - MACD: -711.987 (catastrophically negative)\n  - Price below EMA20 ($113,027) by $2,925\n  - Price action: Severe downtrend from $114,350 to $110,102\n  \n**INVALIDATION CHECK**: Price has NOT reclaimed $112,000 - it's currently at $110,102, well below the $112,000 level mentioned in the invalidation. We are 44 minutes into trading (well beyond \"next 15 minutes\"). The price failed to reclaim $112,000 and is now only $602 above the stop-loss at $109,500. The momentum is severely negative with RSI at 13.152 and MACD at -711.987.\n\n**DECISION**: **CLOSE** - Invalidation condition MET. Failed to reclaim $112,000 within the specified timeframe, and price is in freefall toward stop-loss.\n\n### Market Conditions Assessment\n- **BTC**: Extreme oversold (RSI 13.152), massive MACD divergence (-711.987), losing $4,248 in 30 minutes\n- **ETH**: Extreme oversold (RSI 13.487), strong bearish momentum, losing $209.80 in 30 minutes\n- **SOL**: Moderately weak (RSI 38.638), below EMA20, MACD negative but stabilizing\n- **BNB**: Weak (RSI 41.918), below EMA20, MACD negative\n- **XRP**: Very weak (RSI 16.840), breaking down, MACD turning negative\n- **DOGE**: Weak (RSI 36.784), below EMA20, MACD negative\n\n### Risk Management Decision\nBoth positions have met their invalidation conditions. The market is in severe decline across all major coins. With a -20.48% drawdown, I need to preserve capital and wait for better entry opportunities. The extreme RSI readings suggest potential bounces, but the invalidation conditions were designed to protect against exactly this scenario - momentum failing to recover.\n\n### New Position Opportunities\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions (BTC RSI 13.152, ETH RSI 13.487, XRP RSI 16.840), these could be near-term bounce candidates. However, with invalidation conditions met on existing positions and a significant drawdown, the prudent approach is to close positions, preserve capital, and wait for confirmed reversal signals rather than catching falling knives.\n\n**NO NEW POSITIONS** - Market in severe downtrend, need to preserve remaining capital.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.6,\n      \"profit_target\": 4050.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3875.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price breaks below $3,875 or RSI(7) fails to bounce above 25 within next 15 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 160.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation condition met - RSI(7) at 13.487 failed to bounce above 25 within specified timeframe, MACD deteriorating to -42.487, price approaching stop-loss with accelerating downtrend\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.0014,\n      \"profit_target\": 113500.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 109500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price breaks below $109,500 or fails to reclaim $112,000 within next 15 minutes\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 155.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation condition met - Failed to reclaim $112,000 within timeframe, currently at $110,102 with extreme bearish momentum (RSI 13.152, MACD -711.987), price dangerously close to stop-loss\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Price remains above the invalidation threshold (191.50) by $4.37\n2. RSI shows recovery from oversold (was 27.94, now 49.77)\n3. MACD improving (from -2.368 to -2.064), suggesting weakening bearish momentum\n4. Recent candles show volatility: 193.95 \u2192 198.84 \u2192 192.75 \u2192 197.17 \u2192 195.87\n5. Still below EMA20 (197.89), indicating short-term bearish pressure\n6. Volume elevated (1.11M vs avg 854K), suggesting active trading\n\n**Decision Rationale**:\nThe invalidation condition has NOT been met - price is still $4.37 above the 191.50 threshold. While the position is underwater by -$349, this is within acceptable risk parameters (original risk was $425). The technical picture shows mixed signals: RSI recovering, MACD improving, but price below EMA20. The recent bounce from 192.75 to 197.17 suggests there's support in this area.\n\nHowever, the position is struggling and hasn't gained momentum toward the profit target (204.5). The price action is choppy and indecisive. Given we're 45 minutes into trading with a -24.51% total return and Sharpe ratio of -7.081, risk management is critical.\n\n**DECISION: HOLD** - The invalidation condition is not met. Price needs to close below 191.50 to trigger exit. Will continue monitoring closely.\n\n## Market Overview for Other Coins\n\n### BTC\n- Price: 111,430 (down from 113,694)\n- RSI: 47.4 (neutral but recovering from 12.9 oversold)\n- Below EMA20 (112,864), bearish short-term\n- MACD: -1042 (deeply negative)\n- **Assessment**: Downtrend with some recovery signs, but below EMA20. Not entering.\n\n### ETH\n- Price: 3,938.90 (down from 4,037.60)\n- RSI: 39.97 (recovering from extreme oversold 7.49)\n- Below EMA20 (4,032.56), bearish\n- MACD: -69.53 (negative)\n- **Assessment**: Similar to BTC, recovering from oversold but still weak. Not entering.\n\n### BNB\n- Price: 1,118.20\n- RSI: 61.66 (bullish momentum)\n- Below EMA20 (1,123.98) but close\n- MACD: -10.245 (improving)\n- **Assessment**: Strongest relative strength, but already have SOL exposure. Not adding.\n\n### XRP\n- Price: 2.58\n- RSI: 42.28 (neutral)\n- Below EMA20 (2.61)\n- MACD: -0.014 (slightly negative)\n- **Assessment**: Weak setup, not entering.\n\n### DOGE\n- Price: 0.19254\n- RSI: 40.21 (recovering from extreme 3.08 oversold)\n- Below EMA20 (0.19709)\n- MACD: -0.003 (negative)\n- **Assessment**: Weak, not entering.\n\n## Risk Management Considerations\n- Portfolio down -24.51% with Sharpe -7.081\n- Only one position open (SOL) using ~$49K notional\n- Available cash: $3,818.36\n- Account value: $7,549.34\n- Current exposure: Heavily concentrated in SOL\n\nGiven the poor performance and single concentrated position, maintaining discipline on the invalidation condition is crucial. The condition is clear and has not been met.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 250.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 204.5,\n      \"stop_loss\": 191.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 191.50 (recent swing low) on 3-minute candle, indicating failed reversal and continuation of downtrend\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 425.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

RSI(7) at extreme oversold 15.73, RSI(14) at 19.56. MACD deeply negative at -1446. Price well below EMA20 (112,150). This is capitulation-level selling.\n\n**ETH**: Even worse decline from 3,997 to 3,772 (-5.6%). RSI(7) at extreme 10.29, RSI(14) at 14.77. MACD at -75.59. Price significantly below EMA20 (3,989). Severe oversold conditions.\n\n**SOL**: Down from 193.95 to 185.02 (-4.6%). RSI(7) at 16.29, RSI(14) at 23.64. MACD at -2.25. Below EMA20 (195.60). Heavy selling pressure.\n\n**BNB**: Dropped from 1,103.70 to 1,076.10 (-2.5%). RSI(7) at 15.28, RSI(14) at 21.50. MACD at -17.55. Below EMA20 (1,122). Oversold.\n\n**XRP**: Fell from 2.61 to 2.45 (-6.1%). RSI(7) at extreme 12.08, RSI(14) at 18.59. MACD at -0.026. Below EMA20 (2.59). Severe oversold.\n\n**DOGE**: Collapsed from 0.1929 to 0.1806 (-6.4%). RSI(7) at extreme 10.70, RSI(14) at 16.13. MACD at -0.004. Below EMA20 (0.1942). Capitulation selling.\n\n## Current Portfolio Status\n- No open positions\n- Available cash: $6,554.93\n- Current return: -34.45% (significant drawdown)\n- Sharpe ratio: -8.904 (very poor risk-adjusted returns)\n\n## Trading Decision Rationale\n\nGiven the extreme oversold conditions across ALL cryptocurrencies with RSI(7) readings between 10-16 (deeply oversold), this represents a potential mean reversion opportunity. However, my current portfolio is down -34.45%, indicating poor previous trading decisions.\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. All assets show capitulation-level RSI readings\n2. Volume is significantly elevated (2-3x average), confirming panic selling\n3. MACD deeply negative across all assets\n4. Prices far below their EMAs\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- With only $6,554 remaining (down from $10,000), I need to be extremely cautious\n- The sharp decline could continue (falling knife scenario)\n- However, RSI levels this extreme (10-16) historically indicate short-term bounces\n\n**Strategy:**\nI will take ONE small contrarian position on the most oversold asset (ETH with RSI 10.29) with strict risk management. This is a mean reversion play expecting a bounce from extreme oversold levels. I'll risk only 10% of remaining capital ($655) with tight stop-loss.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 3850.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3730.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price falls below 3730 or RSI(7) drops below 8, indicating continued capitulation rather than bounce\",\n      \"leverage\": 12,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 655.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The price has bounced strongly from oversold conditions (RSI was at 6.56, now 43.35). However, the price is still well below the EMA20 ($3,949.47) and MACD remains deeply negative, indicating the broader downtrend is intact.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. **Profit target proximity:** Only $46.30 away from $3,850 target (1.2%)\n2. **Invalidation NOT met:** Price is well above $3,550 invalidation level\n3. **Technical recovery:** RSI bounce suggests short-term strength\n4. **Risk/reward:** With profit target so close, holding makes sense to capture the full planned gain\n\n**DECISION: HOLD** - The invalidation condition has NOT been met (price is at $3,803.70, well above $3,550). The profit target is very close and the technical bounce supports reaching it. The position is profitable and all exit conditions favor holding for the profit target.\n\n## Other Coins Assessment\n**BTC, SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE:** All showing similar bearish patterns:\n- Prices below EMA20\n- Negative MACD readings\n- RSI in 30-40 range (weak but not extreme oversold)\n- Downtrend momentum intact\n\nGiven the portfolio is down 34% and we have limited capital ($6,117 available), I will NOT open new positions. The market is in a clear downtrend across all coins, and risk management dictates waiting for clearer reversal signals before deploying additional capital.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.22,\n      \"profit_target\": 3850.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3600.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3550 on 3-minute candle, indicating continued capitulation beyond oversold bounce zone\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.72,\n      \"risk_usd\": 300.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
