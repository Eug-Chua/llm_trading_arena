      "raw_response": "# CHAIN OF THOUGHT\nCurrently, there are no open positions in any coin, which means I have the opportunity to evaluate the current market conditions and decide whether to enter any new trades.\n\n1. **BTC**: The current price is $109,160. The EMA20 is at $111,104.55, indicating a bearish trend as the price is below the EMA. The MACD is negative at -1429.362, which reflects downward momentum. The RSI (7-period) is at 43.856, suggesting a neutral condition, but it is trending upwards. However, with the current price being significantly lower than the EMA and negative MACD, the trend appears to be bearish. Therefore, it is not an ideal time to enter a long position.\n\n2. **ETH**: The price is at $3,930.90, also below the EMA20 of $4,023.44, indicating a bearish trend. The MACD of -71.784 is negative, confirming downward momentum. The RSI (7-period) is at 45.554, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold but closer to the neutral zone. Similar to BTC, the bearish indicators do not provide a compelling case for entering a position.\n\n3. **SOL**: The current price is $186.91, under the EMA20 of $195.30. The MACD at -5.057 is negative, and the RSI (7-period) is 35.557, indicating that SOL is approaching oversold territory. However, the overall trend being bearish, combined with the current price below the EMA, suggests caution against entering a long position.\n\n4. **BNB**: The price is $1,149.30, again below the EMA20 of $1,188.16. The MACD is negative at -31.536, and the RSI (7-period) is at 37.756, leaning towards the oversold condition. While it could be considered for a potential bounce, the overall downward trend discourages entering a position.\n\n5. **XRP**: The price is $2.36, below the EMA20 of $2.44. The MACD is -0.058, indicating a lack of momentum, and the RSI (7-period) is at 41.475, which is neutral. The bearish trend and negative indicators do not favor opening a new position.\n\n6. **DOGE**: The price is $0.190230, under the EMA20 of $0.198261. The MACD is negative at -0.005, indicating a bearish trend, and the RSI (7-period) is 37.342, suggesting it is close to oversold but not quite. The overall conditions do not warrant entering a trade here either.\n\nGiven the overall bearish trends across all coins, no significant buying signals are evident. Therefore, I will not enter any new trades.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{}\n```",

Therefore, I will analyze the market conditions and determine whether to open new positions based on the available data.\n\n**BTC**: Current price is $105,589, significantly below the 20-period EMA of $110,349.98, indicating a bearish trend. The MACD is negative at -1386.482, which reinforces the bearish sentiment. The RSI (7-period) is at 17.826, indicating an oversold condition, but this alone is not enough to trigger a buy signal in a strong downtrend. Thus, no position will be opened.\n\n**ETH**: Current price is $3,756.40, also below the EMA at $3,986.21. The MACD at -68.509 suggests bearish momentum, and the RSI at 20.606 indicates oversold conditions. Similar to BTC, the market sentiment is bearish, and there are no compelling signals to buy.\n\n**SOL**: Current price is $177.65, much lower than the EMA of $193.22. With a MACD of -5.298 and an RSI of 16.373, SOL is also in a bearish trend, indicating oversold conditions but not enough to justify a buy.\n\n**BNB**: The price is $1,062.60, below the EMA of $1,174.19. The MACD is -35.001 and the RSI at 9.549 indicates it is very oversold. However, given the overall market conditions, it is not a favorable time to enter a position.\n\n**XRP**: Current price is $2.24, lower than the EMA of $2.41. The MACD at -0.059 and an RSI of 17.426 also indicate bearish momentum with oversold conditions, but again, it does not provide a strong buy signal.\n\n**DOGE**: The price is $0.178490, below the EMA of $0.195551. The MACD is -0.005 and the RSI is at 14.759, indicating it is oversold but similar to the others, the overall market trend is not favorable for opening a position.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the technical indicators and market conditions, I will not open any positions as the market sentiment is bearish across all assets.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{}\n```",

The invalidation condition for this position is not met, as the price is above the stop-loss and the invalidation level. However, the RSI is at **42.15**, suggesting a lack of momentum and potential downward pressure, combined with a negative MACD of **-1407.586**. Despite this, the price is still above the EMA20 of **108494.70**, which may indicate that a bounce back is possible. Given this context, I will decide to **hold** this position for now.\n\n2. **ETH Position:**\n   - Current Price: **3891.40**\n   - Entry Price: **3777.10**\n   - Current Unrealized PnL: **$224.82**\n   - Stop-Loss: **3700.00**\n   - Profit Target: **3900.00**\n   - Invalidation Condition: **If price closes below 3700 on a 3-minute candle**\n\n   This position is also showing a profit and is above the entry price. The invalidation condition is not met, and the current price is very close to the profit target of **3900.00**. The RSI is elevated at **66.49**, which indicates it may be nearing overbought territory. Given the proximity to the profit target and considering risk management, I will set this position to **close** once it hits the profit target or if it violates the stop-loss.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth positions will be assessed based on current market conditions, and since I am close to the profit target in ETH, I will close that position. I will hold BTC for now as its invalidation condition has not been met.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 110000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 104000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 104000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 167.1\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 3900.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3700.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3700 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 154.2,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Profit target nearing\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The invalidation condition (price closing below 104000 on a 3-minute candle) is also not met since the price is above this level.\n\n2. **Technical Indicators**:\n   - **EMA**: The 20-period EMA is at 107771.46, which is above the current price, indicating that the trend is still bearish in the short term.\n   - **MACD**: The MACD value is negative (-942.466), suggesting bearish momentum.\n   - **RSI (7 period)**: Currently at 36.171, which is below 40, indicating oversold conditions. Historically, this can lead to a potential reversal, but it is still considered weak.\n\n3. **Market Sentiment**:\n   - With no open interest in BTC and a neutral funding rate, the market appears stable, but lacks strong bullish momentum.

However, I will monitor closely due to the bearish indicators and lack of volume.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 110000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 104000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 104000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 167.1\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The invalidation condition would be if it drops below the EMA at 0.195765.\n\nGiven the analysis, I will decide to buy BTC, ETH, and SOL due to their strong bullish trends, despite their overbought conditions.

Given the current market dynamics, I will hold the position as it has not triggered any exit conditions.\n\n**ETH Position:**\n- Current Price: 3993.30\n- Entry Price: 4082.90\n- Current Stop-Loss: 3900.00\n- Current Profit Target: 4500.00\n- Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 3954.66 on 3-minute candle.\n\nThe current price is significantly below the entry price, resulting in an unrealized loss. The price is also above the stop-loss level, and the invalidation condition has not yet been triggered. The RSI at 53.430 indicates that ETH is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a potential for recovery. I will hold this position as well since it hasn't triggered the exit conditions.\n\n**SOL Position:**\n- Current Price: 193.80\n- Entry Price: 196.14\n- Current Stop-Loss: 185.00\n- Current Profit Target: 210.00\n- Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 188.66 on 3-minute candle.\n\nSOL is also currently below the entry price but above the stop-loss. The invalidation condition has not been met. The RSI of 65.672 indicates that SOL is leaning towards overbought territory, which could suggest a potential reversal; however, it hasn't triggered any exit conditions yet. I'll hold this position as well.\n\n**Positions Summary:**\n- BTC: HOLD (Invalidation not met; market showing potential)\n- ETH: HOLD (Invalidation not met; market showing potential)\n- SOL: HOLD (Invalidation not met; market showing potential)\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 120000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 109000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 109304.32 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1388.6\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4500.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3900.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3954.66 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 457.75\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 10.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 210.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 185.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 188.66 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 111.4\n    }\n  }\n}",

I will **hold** this position as well, but with caution.\n\n### Overall Decision:\nBoth positions are currently above their respective stop-losses and invalidation conditions. I will hold both BTC and ETH, but I need to be vigilant about potential bearish movements, especially in BTC due to its overbought RSI condition. \n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 112000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 105000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 105000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1500.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3700.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3700 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 3175.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The MACD is positive but flat, suggesting a lack of momentum.\n- Decision: **HOLD** as the position is not close to invalidation and the market conditions are stable.\n\n**BNB**: \n- Current price is 1143.40, with an entry price of 1156.70, showing an unrealized loss of approximately $13.88.\n- The stop-loss is at 1120.00 and the profit target is 1200.00.\n- The invalidation condition is if the price falls below 1120.00 on a 3-minute candle, which is nearby.\n- The RSI is at 45.66, indicating neutrality, while the MACD is positive. \n- Decision: **CLOSE POSITION** because the price is very close to the stop-loss and the indicators do not show enough strength to justify holding.\n\n**XRP**: \n- Current price is 2.66, invalid as I have no position in XRP.\n- No further action required.\n\n**DOGE**: \n- Current price is 0.202820, invalid as I have no position in DOGE.\n- No further action required.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.05,\n      \"profit_target\": 120000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 112000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 112000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 283.00,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Close position due to proximity to stop-loss and bearish signals\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 4400.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 4000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 4000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 406.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 10.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 210.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 195.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 195 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 74.90\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1200.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1120.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1120 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 36.70,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Close position due to proximity to stop-loss\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Currently, the price is significantly above this level, indicating that the invalidation condition is not met.\n- Technical indicators: The current RSI is 75.042, indicating that ETH is in overbought territory but not excessively so. The MACD is positive at 75.978, supporting the continuation of an upward trend.\n- Overall, there\u2019s still potential for a price increase towards the profit target of 4400.00.\n\n**SOL Position Analysis:**\n- Current price: 199.97, Entry price: 202.49\n- The position is currently showing an unrealized loss of about $26. \n- The stop-loss is set at 195.00, which is above the current price for safety. \n- The invalidation condition states that if the price closes below 195 on a 3-minute candle, the position should be closed. The current price is above this level, so the invalidation condition is not met.\n- Technical indicators: The RSI is at 49.507, indicating neutral momentum, while the MACD is also positive but declining at 2.817. This suggests a potential weakening of the upward trend.\n- The profit target is set at 210.00, which is still attainable but requires some bullish momentum to reach.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth positions (ETH and SOL) have not met their invalidation conditions, allowing them to be held. The indicators for ETH suggest a positive outlook, while SOL shows neutral momentum.

I will not enter a position.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 3978.00\n- EMA20: 4072.05 - current price is below EMA, indicating bearish sentiment.\n- MACD is low (18.856) and decreasing, indicating weak bullish momentum.\n- RSI (7 period) is at 11.565, indicating extreme oversold conditions.\n- Conclusion: Similar to BTC, bearish sentiment prevails, and the risk of further declines is significant. No entry for ETH.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 194.24\n- EMA20: 198.06 - price below EMA indicates a bearish trend.\n- MACD (0.526) is low, suggesting weak upward momentum.\n- RSI (7 period) is at 17.724, indicating oversold conditions.\n- Conclusion: The bearish trend and oversold RSI do not present a buying opportunity.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 1102.30\n- EMA20: 1131.00 - indicates bearish sentiment as price is below EMA.\n- MACD (0.816) is weak and declining, indicating loss of bullish momentum.\n- RSI (7 period) is at 12.382, suggesting extreme oversold conditions.\n- Conclusion: No favorable conditions for entry into a position.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 2.60\n- EMA20: 2.63 - bearish trend as price is below the EMA.\n- MACD (0.005) indicates very low momentum.\n- RSI (7 period) is low at 21.015, suggesting oversold conditions.\n- Conclusion: The trend is bearish with no clear buy signal.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 0.193560\n- EMA20: 0.199558 - again, price is below the EMA indicating bearish conditions.\n- MACD is near zero, indicating no strong momentum.\n- RSI (7 period) is at 7.266, which is very low.\n- Conclusion: The conditions are not supportive of a buy.\n\nOverall, all coins are in bearish trends with significant oversold conditions, but without clear signals to warrant entering positions.

However, it is still above the stop-loss level. The invalidation condition has not been met as the price is still above 112100. The MACD is positive but showing a downward trend, and RSI indicates the asset is oversold at 41.262. Given these factors, the decision is to hold the position as it hasn't met the invalidation condition yet.\n\n### ETH Position Analysis:\n- **Current Price:** 4008.70, **Entry Price:** 4022.80\n- **Stop-Loss:** 3970.00, **Profit Target:** 4100.00\n- **Invalidation Condition:** If price closes below 3980 on a 3-minute candle.\n- The current price is also below the entry price, leading to an unrealized loss. The price is above the stop-loss and invalidation condition, which has not been met. The RSI of 34.291 indicates a bearish trend, and the MACD is slightly positive but trending downwards. Given this analysis, I will hold the position since it's above the stop-loss and invalidation condition.\n\n### SOL Position Analysis:\n- **Current Price:** 198.84, **Entry Price:** 195.67\n- **Stop-Loss:** 193.00, **Profit Target:** 200.00\n- **Invalidation Condition:** If price closes below 194 on a 3-minute candle.\n- This position is in profit with a small unrealized gain. The current price is above both the stop-loss and the invalidation condition. The RSI indicates a strong momentum with a value of 65.373. Therefore, the decision is to hold the position as it shows strong potential without hitting the stop-loss or invalidation condition.\n\n### XRP Position Analysis:\n- **Current Price:** 2.65, **Entry Price:** 2.6336\n- **Stop-Loss:** 2.57, **Profit Target:** 2.70\n- **Invalidation Condition:** If price closes below 2.60 on a 3-minute candle.\n- This position is slightly in profit. The current price is above the entry price and both the stop-loss and invalidation condition are intact. The RSI is at 67.091, which indicates a slightly overbought condition but not extreme. Thus, I will hold the position as it remains above the critical levels.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn summary, all positions are currently above their respective stop-loss levels and invalidation conditions. Although BTC and ETH are showing unrealized losses, they haven't reached their exit conditions, prompting a hold decision for all positions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 115000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 112000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 112100 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 569.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4100.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3970.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3980 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 130.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 193.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 194 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 13.5\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 50.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.70,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.57,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.60 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 3.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Given the market conditions and the indicators across different cryptocurrencies, I will assess whether to open new positions or not.\n\n1. **BTC**: \n   Current price is 110102.00, with a significant downtrend indicated by the EMA (20-period at 113027.14). The MACD is negative, and the RSI is extremely low at 13.152, indicating oversold conditions. However, the trend is strongly bearish, and I would avoid entering a position until a reversal signal is confirmed.\n\n2. **ETH**: \n   Current price stands at 3902.00, below the EMA (20-period at 4032.45). The MACD is also negative, and the RSI is at 13.487, showing extreme oversold conditions. Despite the oversold signal, the overall trend is bearish, so it\u2019s prudent to wait for a more convincing reversal.\n\n3. **SOL**: \n   The current price is 193.99, below the EMA (20-period at 197.29). The MACD is negative, and the RSI is at 38.638, indicating some weakness but not in extreme oversold territory. Still, the trend is not favorable for entering a new position.\n\n4. **BNB**: \n   Current price is 1107.20, below the EMA (20-period at 1121.28). The MACD is negative, and the RSI at 41.918 shows some weakness but is not at an extreme. Similar to SOL, although it does not indicate an immediate sell-off, conditions are not ideal for entering a trade.\n\n5. **XRP**: \n   Current price is 2.55, slightly below the EMA (20-period at 2.62). The MACD is negative, and the RSI at 16.840 indicates oversold conditions. However, like BTC and ETH, the trend remains bearish.\n\n6. **DOGE**: \n   Current price is 0.192270, with the EMA (20-period at 0.197204) above the price. The MACD is negative, and the RSI is at 36.784, with general bearish momentum. \n\nIn summary, all coins are in bearish trends, with some showing oversold conditions but without any clear reversal signals. Therefore, it is not advisable to open any new positions at this time.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{}\n```",

Although the RSI suggests oversold territory, the overall trend remains bearish. Therefore, I will **close the position** to limit potential losses.\n\n2. **ETH**: \n   - **Current Price**: 3933.40\n   - **EMA20**: 4035.59 (price is below EMA indicating bearish trend)\n   - **MACD**: -61.464 (indicating downward momentum)\n   - **RSI (7-period)**: 36.350 (indicating weak bullish momentum)\n   - **Invalidation Condition**: If price closes below 3900 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - The price is below the EMA20 and the MACD is also negative, indicating bearish conditions. The RSI suggests limited upward momentum. Thus, I will **close the position** to mitigate risk.\n\n3. **SOL**: \n   - **Current Price**: 197.17\n   - **EMA20**: 197.45 (price is slightly below EMA)\n   - **MACD**: -1.329 (indicating bearish trend)\n   - **RSI (7-period)**: 58.845 (indicating no extreme conditions)\n   - **Invalidation Condition**: If price closes below 192.00 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - The price is fluctuating around the EMA, but the MACD is negative and the overall trend is bearish. The RSI indicates some strength, but not enough to justify a buy. Therefore, I will **close the position** to avoid potential losses.\n\n4. **BNB**: \n   - **Current Price**: 1118.30\n   - **EMA20**: 1122.59 (price is below EMA)\n   - **MACD**: -8.589 (indicating bearish trend)\n   - **RSI (7-period)**: 62.011 (indicating relatively high momentum)\n   - **Invalidation Condition**: If price closes below 1110 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Despite the RSI suggesting some potential strength, the overall trend is still bearish with the price below the EMA and MACD negative. Hence, I will **close the position**.\n\n5. **XRP**: \n   - **Current Price**: 2.58\n   - **EMA20**: 2.62 (price is slightly below EMA)\n   - **MACD**: -0.015 (indicating bearish trend)\n   - **RSI (7-period)**: 38.981 (neutral)\n   - **Invalidation Condition**: If price closes below 2.55 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Similar to other coins, the bearish trend signals a need to exit. Therefore, I will **close the position**.\n\n6. **DOGE**: \n   - **Current Price**: 0.193680\n   - **EMA20**: 0.197401 (price is below EMA)\n   - **MACD**: -0.003 (indicating bearish trend)\n   - **RSI (7-period)**: 48.128 (neutral)\n   - **Invalidation Condition**: If price closes below 0.190 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - The price below the EMA along with a negative MACD indicates a bearish trend. Thus, I will **close the position**.\n\nGiven that I have no open positions, I will not provide any buy or hold signals.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": null,\n      \"stop_loss\": null,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 105000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation met, bearish trend confirmed\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": null,\n      \"stop_loss\": null,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3900 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.70,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation met, bearish trend confirmed\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": null,\n      \"stop_loss\": null,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 192.00 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation met, bearish trend confirmed\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": null,\n      \"stop_loss\": null,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1110 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.60,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation met, bearish trend confirmed\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": null,\n      \"stop_loss\": null,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.55 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation met, bearish trend confirmed\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": null,\n      \"stop_loss\": null,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.190 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.50,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation met, bearish trend confirmed\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The invalidation condition is not met, so I will hold this position. The MACD is negative, indicating potential bearish momentum, but the RSI is at 41.193 which suggests that the market is not yet oversold. \n\n**ETH:**\n- Current price: 3803.70\n- Entry price: 3688.00\n- Unrealized PnL: 227.71\n- Stop-loss: 3500.00\n- Profit target: 3900.00\n- Invalidation condition: If price closes above 3900.00 on a 3-minute candle.\n\nETH is also performing well, with the current price above the entry price and below the profit target. The invalidation condition is not met, so I will hold this position. The RSI at 43.352 suggests that ETH is not overbought, providing a reasonable opportunity to reach the profit target.\n\n**SOL:**\n- Current price: 184.62\n- Entry price: 179.02\n- Unrealized PnL: 27.55\n- Stop-loss: 170.00\n- Profit target: 185.00\n- Invalidation condition: If price closes above 185.00 on a 3-minute candle.\n\nSOL is just shy of the profit target but is still above the stop-loss. The invalidation condition is not met either, so I will continue to hold this position. The RSI at 37.873 indicates that it is approaching oversold conditions, which may give it a bounce.\n\n**BNB:**\n- Current price: 1078.20\n- Entry price: 1061.20\n- Unrealized PnL: 24.70\n- Stop-loss: 1000.00\n- Profit target: 1100.00\n- Invalidation condition: If price closes above 1100.00 on a 3-minute candle.\n\nBNB is performing slightly above the entry price, and the invalidation condition is not met. Thus, I will hold this position as well. The RSI is at 37.084, indicating that it is also approaching oversold territory.\n\n**XRP:**\n- Current price: 2.44\n- Entry price: 2.383\n- Unrealized PnL: 2.68\n- Stop-loss: 2.20\n- Profit target: 2.45\n- Invalidation condition: If price closes above 2.45 on a 3-minute candle.\n\nXRP is near its profit target and above the stop-loss. The invalidation condition is not met, so I will hold this position. The RSI is at 32.819, indicating that it is close to oversold conditions, but it is not yet at that threshold.\n\nOverall, all positions are held as none of the invalidation conditions are met, and the stop-loss levels are intact.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 109784.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 105000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes above 109784.00 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 512.6\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 3900.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes above 3900.00 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 200.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 185.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes above 185.00 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 45.1\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 1100.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes above 1100.00 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 91.8\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 50.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.45,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.20,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes above 2.45 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 9.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
