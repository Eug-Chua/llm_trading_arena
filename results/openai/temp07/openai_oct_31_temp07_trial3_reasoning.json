SOL and BNB are more neutral with potential for slight upward movement, but not strong enough to warrant a buy signal at this moment without confirmation.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 115000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 107000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 107000 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 841.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4200.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3900.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3900 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 207.50\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 10,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 185.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 185 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 38.10\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5,\n      \"profit_target\": 1150.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1100.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1100 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 80.50\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 50,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.60,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.30,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 35.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 200,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.22,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.185,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.185 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 23.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The price is currently above this level, and the invalidation condition (closing below 107000 on a 3-minute candle) is not met. \n- Decision: **HOLD** - although the RSI suggests overbought conditions, the MACD indicates ongoing bullish momentum, and the price is still above the stop-loss.\n\n**ETH Position:**\n- Current Price: 3980.40, Entry Price: 3983.70\n- Current RSI: 82.614 is extremely high, indicating an overbought market, which can lead to a price reversal.\n- The MACD (27.512) is also positive but shows signs of a potential slowdown.\n- The stop-loss is at 3900.

The invalidation condition (closing below 185) is not met.\n- Decision: **HOLD** - while the momentum is weak, we remain above the stop-loss.\n\n**BNB Position:**\n- Current Price: 1109.00, Entry Price: 1116.10\n- Current RSI: 56.503 indicates a favorable position but not overly strong.\n- The MACD (-5.908) is negative, indicating bearish momentum.\n- Stop-loss is at 1100, which we are currently above, and the invalidation condition (closing below 1100) is not met.\n- Decision: **HOLD** - although the MACD is bearish, the price remains above the stop-loss.\n\n**XRP Position:**\n- Current Price: 2.39, Entry Price: 2.3976\n- Current RSI: 62.058 indicates a relatively healthy bullish momentum.\n- The MACD (0.018) is positive but close to neutral.\n- The stop-loss is at 2.30, and the price is still above this level. The invalidation condition (closing below 2.30) is not met.\n- Decision: **HOLD** - the position is stable, and we are above the stop-loss.\n\n**DOGE Position:**\n- Current Price: 0.195270, Entry Price: 0.19669\n- Current RSI: 68.474 indicates a near overbought condition.\n- The MACD (0.002) is positive but minimal, suggesting weak momentum.\n- The stop-loss is at 0.185, well above the current price level.

However, I will hold this position for now.\n\nOverall, I will hold all positions as none have hit their stop-loss or invalidation conditions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 115000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 107000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 107000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 841.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3900.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3900 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 207.5\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 10.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 185.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 185 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 38.1\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1150.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1100.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1100 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 80.5\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 50.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.6,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.3,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.30 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 35.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 200.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.22,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.185,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.185 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 23.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The RSI (7-period) is at 52.54, which indicates a neutral stance, suggesting that there might be potential for upward movement.\n- Decision: **HOLD** as the invalidation condition has not been triggered.\n\n**SOL Position:**\n- Current Price: 190.41, Entry Price: 188.81\n- The position has a small unrealized PnL of approximately $15.06.\n- The exit plan includes a profit target of 195.0 and a stop-loss at 185.0, with an invalidation condition if the price closes below 185 on a 3-minute candle.\n- Current price is above both the stop-loss and invalidation condition. The RSI is neutral at 50.53, indicating that the market is balanced.\n- Decision: **HOLD** since the invalidation condition is still intact.\n\n**BNB Position:**\n- Current Price: 1110.10, Entry Price: 1116.1\n- This position is currently at a loss of about $32.79.\n- The exit plan includes a profit target of 1150.0 and a stop-loss at 1100.0. The invalidation condition is if the price closes below 1100 on a 3-minute candle.\n- The current price is dangerously close to the stop-loss and invalidation condition. Given that the RSI is at 43.95, indicating potential bearish momentum, risk management suggests that we should consider closing this position.\n- Decision: **CLOSE_POSITION** due to the risk of hitting the stop-loss.\n\n**XRP Position:**\n- Current Price: 2.46, Entry Price: 2.3976\n- The position is profitable, with an unrealized PnL of approximately $3.16.\n- The exit plan includes a profit target of 2.6, stop-loss at 2.3, with an invalidation condition if the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle.\n- The current price is above both the stop-loss and invalidation levels. The RSI at 77.23 indicates a potential overbought situation, yet the upward momentum remains.\n- Decision: **HOLD** as the position is not at risk.\n\n**DOGE Position:**\n- Current Price: 0.199280, Entry Price: 0.19669\n- The position has a small unrealized PnL of about $0.50.\n- The exit plan has a profit target of 0.22 and a stop-loss at 0.185, with an invalidation condition if the price closes below 0.185 on a 3-minute candle.\n- The current price is well above both the stop-loss and invalidation levels. The RSI at 65.05 suggests there is still room for growth before reaching overbought conditions.\n- Decision: **HOLD** as the invalidation condition is intact.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 115000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 107000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 107000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 841.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3900.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3900 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 207.5\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 10.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 185.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 185 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 38.1\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1150.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1100.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1100 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 80.5,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Risk management - price approaching stop-loss\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 50.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.6,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.3,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.30 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 35.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 200.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.22,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.185,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.185 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 23.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, the RSI of 33.958 indicates that BTC is in an oversold condition, potentially hinting at a reversal. \n   - Given the invalidation condition is not met, I will hold the position but keep a close eye on the price.\n\n2. **XRP Position Analysis**:\n   - Current price: $2.4301, Entry price: $2.3976. This position is currently showing a small unrealized profit of approximately $0.0325.\n   - The stop-loss is at $2.3000, and the invalidation condition states that if the price closes below $2.30 on a 3-minute candle, the position should be closed.\n   - The current price is well above the stop-loss, indicating that the position remains valid.\n   - Technical indicators: The EMA20 is at $2.42, and the MACD is at 0.026, suggesting a neutral trend. The RSI at 38.327 indicates that XRP is not in an overbought condition, which is favorable. \n   - Since the invalidation condition is not met, I will continue to hold the position, especially since it is showing a small profit.\n\n3. **DOGE Position Analysis**:\n   - Current price: $0.194430, Entry price: $0.19669. The position is currently down approximately $0.00226.\n   - The stop-loss is set at $0.185, and the invalidation condition states that if the price closes below $0.185 on a 3-minute candle, the position should be closed. \n   - The current price is above the stop-loss level, meaning the position remains valid.\n   - Technical indicators: With an EMA20 of $0.194846 and an RSI of 26.377, DOGE is in an oversold condition, which may indicate a potential reversal. However, the MACD is neutral at 0.002.\n   - Although the position is showing a loss, the invalidation condition is not met, so I will hold onto this position for now but remain cautious.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 115000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 107000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 107000 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 841.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 50.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.6,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.3,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 35.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 200.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.22,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.185,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.185 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 23.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The profit target of $2.6 is not too far above the current price, which could be achievable if the market continues to show favorable conditions.\n\nNo other positions are held in other coins, so I will not be assessing or trading those.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 50.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.6,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.3,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.30 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 35.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The RSI (44.918) indicates that the market is approaching oversold conditions, but it is below the typical threshold of 50, suggesting weakness. Given that the invalidation condition has not been met yet, the position will be held for now, but close monitoring is required as it is nearing the stop loss.\n\n2. **ETH**: \n   - Current price: 3931.30, Entry price: 3957.60 (Down $26.30)\n   - Stop-loss: 3860.00, Profit target: 4200.00\n   - Invalidation condition: If price closes below 3900 on a 3-minute candle\n   - Analysis: Similar to BTC, ETH is currently below its 20 EMA (3906.20) and nearing the stop-loss. The RSI (43.967) is also low, indicating potential weakness in the market. The invalidation condition has not yet been met, so I will hold this position, but it is close to the invalidation point.\n\n3. **SOL**: \n   - Current price: 192.91, Entry price: 194.42 (Down $1.51)\n   - Stop-loss: 188.00, Profit target: 200.00\n   - Invalidation condition: If price closes below 192.00 on a 3-minute candle\n   - Analysis: SOL is slightly below its 20 EMA (190.47) but above the invalidation condition. The RSI (48.349) suggests it is neutral. Since the price is above the invalidation level, I will hold this position, but it's essential to watch for any further declines.\n\n4. **BNB**: \n   - Current price: 1116.60, Entry price: 1115.70 (Up $0.90)\n   - Stop-loss: 1080.00, Profit target: 1150.00\n   - Invalidation condition: If price closes below 1100 on a 3-minute candle\n   - Analysis: BNB is above its 20 EMA (1108.01) and is slightly in profit. The RSI (58.942) is nearing overbought territory but still indicates potential upward momentum. The invalidation condition has not been met, so I will hold this position as well.\n\n5. **XRP, DOGE**: No positions in these coins.

      "raw_response": "# CHAIN OF THOUGHT\nReviewing my current positions:\n\n1. **BTC**: Current price is 111756.00, with an entry price of 111669.00. The position is currently showing a small unrealized profit of approximately $2.49. The stop-loss is set at 108000.00 and the profit target at 115000.00. The invalidation condition states that if the price closes below 110000 on a 3-minute candle, I should exit. The current price is above the invalidation level, and the RSI at 65.51 indicates a moderately strong bullish momentum. The MACD is also positive, suggesting potential for further upward movement. Decision: **HOLD - no exit conditions met.**\n\n2. **ETH**: Current price is at 3951.50, while my entry was at 3957.60, resulting in an unrealized loss of approximately $20.20. The stop-loss is at 3860.00 and the profit target is at 4200.00. The invalidation condition indicates that if the price closes below 3900 on a 3-minute candle, I should exit. The current price is just above the invalidation level, but the RSI of 60.43 indicates that it's not oversold or overbought, and the MACD is slightly positive. Given the proximity to the invalidation level and the current loss, it may be prudent to monitor closely. Decision: **HOLD - no exit conditions met.**\n\n3. **SOL**: Current price is 193.77, with an entry price of 194.42, resulting in a small unrealized loss of about $3.74. The stop-loss is at 188.00 and the profit target at 200.00. The invalidation condition is if the price closes below 192.00 on a 3-minute candle. The current price is below this level, which justifies reconsideration of the position. The RSI indicates a neutral momentum at 58.67, and the MACD is positive, but not strongly so. Decision: **CLOSE_POSITION - Invalidation condition met (price closes below 192.00).**\n\n4. **BNB**: Current price is 1120.00, entry price is 1115.70, leading to a small unrealized profit of approximately $11.23. The stop-loss is at 1080.00, and the profit target is at 1150.00. The invalidation condition is if the price closes below 1100.00 on a 3-minute candle. The current price is above this level, and the RSI at 68.03 indicates bullish momentum, nearing overbought territory. Decision: **HOLD - no exit conditions met.**\n\n5. **XRP**: No position.\n\n6. **DOGE**: No position.\n\nIn summary, I will hold positions in BTC, ETH, and BNB, while closing the SOL position due to the invalidation condition being met.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.08,\n      \"profit_target\": 115000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 108000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 110000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1344.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3860.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3900 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 237.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 188.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 192.00 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.68,\n      \"risk_usd\": 31.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation condition met\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 3.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1150.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1080.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1100 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 105.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The RSI is at 84.446, indicating that BTC is overbought, and we need to be cautious. However, the bullish momentum is still strong as indicated by the MACD. Decision: **HOLD** - Maintain the position as the invalidation condition is not met.\n\n**ETH Position Analysis**:  \n- Current Price: 4067.30  \n- Entry Price: 3957.60  \n- Stop-Loss: 3860.00  \n- Profit Target: 4200.00  \n- Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 3900 on a 3-minute candle.  \n- The price is well above the stop-loss and the invalidation condition has not been met, with the price remaining above 3900. The RSI is at 82.939, also indicating an overbought condition, but the MACD shows positive momentum. Decision: **HOLD** - Keep the position as the invalidation condition is not met.\n\n**BNB Position Analysis**:  \n- Current Price: 1126.20  \n- Entry Price: 1115.70  \n- Stop-Loss: 1080.00  \n- Profit Target: 1150.00  \n- Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 1100 on a 3-minute candle.  \n- The current price is above the stop-loss and the invalidation condition has not been triggered, maintaining a bullish stance. However, the RSI at 54.603 suggests neutral momentum without strong buying pressure. Decision: **HOLD** - The invalidation condition is not met, so we keep the position open.\n\n**Summary**:  \nAll positions (BTC, ETH, BNB) are to be held as the invalidation conditions for each have not been met, and the price remains above the respective stop-loss levels.

The invalidation condition states that if the price closes below $112000 on a 3-minute candle, the position should be closed.\n- Currently, the price is above the stop-loss at $112000, so I am not meeting the invalidation condition yet.\n- The 20-period EMA is at $113738.52, indicating a slight downtrend since the price is below the EMA. The MACD is at 649.261, which is showing a bearish trend, as it has significantly decreased from previous values. The RSI (7-period) is at 30.983, indicating that BTC is currently in oversold territory.\n- Given the current conditions, the price is moving closer to the invalidation condition. However, it hasn't been breached yet, and the potential profit target is still viable.

The invalidation condition states that if the price closes below 109000 on a 3-minute candle, the position must be exited. The current price of 110102 is above the stop-loss of 109000.\n- Technical Indicators: The current RSI is extremely low at 13.152, indicating an oversold condition. However, the MACD is negative and trending downwards, suggesting bearish momentum. The EMA is also declining, confirming a downward trend.\n- Decision: While the current price has not hit the stop-loss or invalidation condition, the overall bearish trend and low RSI indicate that the market may continue to decline. However, holding is justified as it hasn't yet reached the exit conditions.\n\n**ETH Position:**\n- Current Price: 3902.00, Entry Price: 3949.50\n- Similar to BTC, the current price is below the entry price, resulting in an unrealized loss. The invalidation condition is if the price closes below 3850 on a 3-minute candle. The current price is above this stop-loss level.\n- Technical Indicators: The RSI is at an extremely low level of 13.487, indicating oversold conditions, while the MACD is also negative and declining. The EMA is also in a downtrend, indicating bearish momentum.\n- Decision: Given the current conditions, I will hold the position; it hasn't reached the stop-loss or invalidation conditions, and the oversold RSI may lead to a potential bounce.\n\n**BNB Position:**\n- Current Price: 1107.20, Entry Price: 1098.90\n- The current price is slightly above the entry price with a small unrealized gain. The invalidation condition states that if the price closes below 1050 on a 3-minute candle, I should exit the position, and the current price is far above this stop-loss.\n- Technical Indicators: The RSI is at 41.918, which is not in extreme territory. The MACD is negative but showing a slight flattening, and the EMA also indicates a downtrend.\n- Decision: While the position is in a slight profit, the overall bearish sentiment in the market is concerning. I will hold this position as it hasn't reached the invalidation condition.\n\n**DOGE Position:**\n- Current Price: 0.192270, Entry Price: 0.19098\n- The current price is above the entry price with a small unrealized profit. The invalidation condition is if the price closes below 0.185 on a 3-minute candle, and the current price is well above this threshold.\n- Technical Indicators: The RSI is at 36.784, which is near the neutral zone. The MACD is negative but also showing signs of stability. The EMA is slightly declining.\n- Decision: Given the small profit and the fact that the price is above both the stop-loss and invalidation conditions, I will hold this position as well.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.05,\n      \"profit_target\": 115000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 109000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 109000 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 250.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4050.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3850.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3850 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 250.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 1150.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1050.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1050 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 250.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 10000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.195,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.185,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.185 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 250.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The invalidation condition has not yet been met since the last price close has not crossed below 109000. The RSI is at 26.909, indicating oversold conditions, but MACD is negative. Given the current bearish trend and the proximity to the stop-loss, I will decide to **close this position** to mitigate further losses.\n\n2. **ETH**:\n   - Current Price: 3880.70, Entry Price: 3949.50\n   - Unrealized PNL: -176.94\n   - Exit Plan: Profit Target: 4050.00, Stop-Loss: 3850.00\n   - Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 3850 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - **Analysis**: The price is below the entry but above the stop-loss.

The RSI at 44.348 indicates a neutral condition. Despite the positive unrealized PNL, I see no immediate reason to close the position or adjust it, so I will **hold this position**.\n\n4. **DOGE**:\n   - Current Price: 0.187840, Entry Price: 0.19098\n   - Unrealized PNL: -32.35\n   - Exit Plan: Profit Target: 0.195, Stop-Loss: 0.185\n   - Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 0.185 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - **Analysis**: The price is below both the entry price and the stop-loss. The RSI is at 21.163, showing oversold signals. Given the current position is near the stop-loss and the negative trend, I will **close this position** to avoid further losses.\n\n**Final Decisions**:\n- Close BTC and DOGE positions to limit losses.\n- Hold ETH and BNB positions for potential recovery.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.05,\n      \"profit_target\": 115000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 109000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 109000 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 250.00,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation condition not met, but stop-loss is near.\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4050.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3850.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3850 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 250.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 1150.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1050.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1050 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 250.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 10000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.195,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.185,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.185 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 250.00,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation condition not met, and stop-loss is near.\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, the MACD is negative at -1681.654, which suggests bearish momentum. The RSI at 41.193 indicates that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold, but leaning towards bearish. The invalidation condition has not been met yet, and the stop-loss is well below the current price. \n   - **Decision:** HOLD - no exit conditions met yet.\n\n2. **ETH:**\n   - **Current Price:** 3803.70, **Entry Price:** 3688.00\n   - **Profit Target:** 3961.75, **Stop Loss:** 3500.00\n   - **Invalidation Condition:** If price closes below 3500 on 3-minute candle.\n   - The current price is above the entry price, resulting in unrealized gains. The MACD is negative at -96.613, indicating bearish momentum, while the RSI at 43.352 shows a neutral stance. The invalidation condition has not been triggered. \n   - **Decision:** HOLD - conditions for exit are not met.\n\n3. **SOL:**\n   - **Current Price:** 184.62, **Entry Price:** 179.02\n   - **Profit Target:** 194.01, **Stop Loss:** 170.00\n   - **Invalidation Condition:** If price closes below 170 on 3-minute candle.\n   - The current price is above the entry price, but the momentum indicators show weakness, with the MACD at -3.576 and RSI at 37.873, suggesting a bearish trend. Since the invalidation condition has not yet been met, I will not exit just yet.\n   - **Decision:** HOLD - conditions for exit are not met.\n\n4. **BNB:**\n   - **Current Price:** 1078.20, **Entry Price:** 1061.20\n   - **Profit Target:** 1111.37, **Stop Loss:** 1000.00\n   - **Invalidation Condition:** If price closes below 1000 on 3-minute candle.\n   - The position is currently in profit. The MACD is negative at -14.830 and the RSI is at 37.084, indicating weakness. The invalidation condition has not been triggered, hence the position can be held.\n   - **Decision:** HOLD - conditions for exit are not met.\n\n5. **XRP:**\n   - **Current Price:** 2.44, **Entry Price:** 2.383\n   - **Profit Target:** 2.58, **Stop Loss:** 2.00\n   - **Invalidation Condition:** If price closes below 2.00 on 3-minute candle.\n   - Price is currently above the entry price providing a slight profit. However, the MACD is negative at -0.052, and the RSI at 32.819 indicates the asset is nearing oversold levels. The invalidation condition has not been met.\n   - **Decision:** HOLD - conditions for exit are not met.\n\n6. **DOGE:**\n   - **Current Price:** 0.18253, **Entry Price:** 0.17684\n   - **Profit Target:** 0.19253, **Stop Loss:** 0.16\n   - **Invalidation Condition:** If price closes below 0.16 on 3-minute candle.\n   - The position is slightly profitable. The MACD is negative at -0.005, and the RSI at 39.256 shows a neutral stance. The invalidation condition has not been triggered yet.\n   - **Decision:** HOLD - conditions for exit are not met.\n\n**Summary:** All positions are currently held as none of the invalidation conditions have been met, and the market shows varying degrees of bearish momentum but not enough to warrant closing positions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 111562.07,\n      \"stop_loss\": 104000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 105000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1500.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 3961.75,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3500 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 470.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 194.01,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 170 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 45.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1111.37,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 61.2\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 50.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.58,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.00 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 19.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.19253,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.16,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.160000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 16.68\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
