Therefore, I will analyze the potential trading opportunities based on the current market data for each of the coins: BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP, and DOGE. \n\n### BTC:\n- **Current Price**: 105589.00, **EMA(20)**: 110349.98, **MACD**: -1386.482, **RSI (7)**: 17.826\n- The price is currently below the 20-period EMA, indicating a downtrend. The MACD is negative, suggesting bearish momentum. The RSI shows that BTC is oversold (below 20), which might present a potential buying opportunity if bullish indicators emerge.\n- **Decision**: I will consider buying BTC but will set a stop-loss below recent low levels to manage risk.\n\n### ETH:\n- **Current Price**: 3756.40, **EMA(20)**: 3986.21, **MACD**: -68.509, **RSI (7)**: 20.606\n- Similar to BTC, ETH is also below the 20-period EMA and shows a bearish trend. The MACD is negative, and the RSI indicates it is oversold. This may also present a buying opportunity.\n- **Decision**: I will consider buying ETH with risk management in place.\n\n### SOL:\n- **Current Price**: 177.65, **EMA(20)**: 193.22, **MACD**: -5.298, **RSI (7)**: 16.373\n- SOL shows a strong bearish trend as well, being significantly below the EMA. The MACD is negative, indicating further downside potential, and the RSI suggests it is oversold.\n- **Decision**: Buying SOL could be considered, but caution is warranted due to the strong downtrend.\n\n### BNB:\n- **Current Price**: 1062.60, **EMA(20)**: 1174.19, **MACD**: -35.001, **RSI (7)**: 9.549\n- BNB is deeply in the bearish territory, with a very low RSI, which indicates extreme oversold conditions. However, the trend is strongly downward, and it could rebound, but the risk is high.\n- **Decision**: I will consider buying BNB cautiously.\n\n### XRP:\n- **Current Price**: 2.24, **EMA(20)**: 2.41, **MACD**: -0.059, **RSI (7)**: 17.426\n- XRP shows signs of being oversold with a low RSI, but the EMA and MACD indicate that the bearish trend is still intact. \n- **Decision**: Buying XRP is risky under current conditions.\n\n### DOGE:\n- **Current Price**: 0.178490, **EMA(20)**: 0.195551, **MACD**: -0.005, **RSI (7)**: 14.759\n- DOGE is also in a bearish trend, with the price below the EMA and a very low RSI reading. \n- **Decision**: Buying DOGE could be considered, but the overall market sentiment is bearish.\n\nGiven the analysis, I will proceed with buying opportunities for BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, and DOGE while ensuring that appropriate stop-losses and profit targets are established to manage risk.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 112000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 102000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 102000 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1000.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3600.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3600 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 390.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 10,\n      \"profit_target\": 200.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 170 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 76.50\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5,\n      \"profit_target\": 1200.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.45,\n      \"risk_usd\": 310.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5000,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.20,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.15,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.15 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.4,\n      \"risk_usd\": 170.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The MACD is negative, indicating bearish momentum, and the RSI is near the neutral level, suggesting no strong buying pressure. Given these conditions, I will continue to hold the position as the invalidation condition has not been met.\n\n**ETH:**\n- Current Price: 3797.30, Entry Price: 3756.40\n- Current EMA20: 3927.90, MACD: -49.574, RSI (7-period): 33.917\n- Current Exit Plan: Profit Target: 4000.00, Stop Loss: 3600.00\n- Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 3600 on a 3-minute candle.\n\nETH is trading slightly above the entry price, but the overall trend remains bearish, with the current price well below the EMA20 and a negative MACD. The RSI indicates oversold conditions, but not strongly enough to suggest a reversal. The invalidation condition is still safe, so I will hold this position as well.\n\n**SOL:**\n- Current Price: 182.74, Entry Price: 177.65\n- Current EMA20: 189.96, MACD: -3.878, RSI (7-period): 41.565\n- Current Exit Plan: Profit Target: 200.00, Stop Loss: 170.00\n- Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 170 on a 3-minute candle.\n\nSOL is above the entry price and still has a reasonable distance to the stop loss. However, it is below the EMA20 and has a negative MACD. The RSI suggests some recovery potential, but overall, the bearish trend remains.

The MACD is negative, and the RSI is very low, suggesting that the asset may be oversold. Given these bearish indicators, I will hold this position since the invalidation level is not yet breached.\n\n**DOGE:**\n- Current Price: 0.184750, Entry Price: 0.17849\n- Current EMA20: 0.192365, MACD: -0.004, RSI (7-period): 42.470\n- Current Exit Plan: Profit Target: 0.20, Stop Loss: 0.15\n- Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 0.15 on a 3-minute candle.\n\nDOGE is trading above the entry price, but it remains below the EMA20. The MACD is neutral, and the RSI indicates a modest level of bullish momentum. I will continue to hold this position as the invalidation condition is still intact.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 112000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 102000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 102000 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1000.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3600.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3600 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 390.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 10.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 170 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 76.5\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.45,\n      \"risk_usd\": 310.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.20,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.15,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.15 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.4,\n      \"risk_usd\": 170.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The stop-loss is set at 102000.00, which is not threatened, and the invalidation condition (price closing below 102000.00 on a 3-minute candle) is also intact. The RSI is at 35.342, indicating a potentially oversold condition but not strongly so, and the MACD is negative, suggesting bearish momentum. However, given the current price is above the entry and the invalidation conditions are not met, the decision is to **HOLD** the position.\n\n2. **ETH**: Current price is 3825.70 with an entry price of 3756.40. The unrealized P&L is also positive (+168.55). The stop-loss is 3600.00, which is safe from the current price. The invalidation condition (if price closes below 3600 on a 3-minute candle) is intact. The RSI at 43.710 suggests it is moving towards oversold but is currently stable, while the MACD is negative. Since the position is still profitable and conditions are stable, I will **HOLD**.\n\n3. **SOL**: Current price is 181.93 with an entry of 177.65, resulting in a small profit (+41.91). The stop-loss is at 170.00, which is not close, and the invalidation condition is safe as well. The RSI at 38.373 indicates slight bullishness, but the MACD is negative. Given the current market conditions and the fact that the position is not at risk, I will **HOLD**.\n\n4. **BNB**: Current price is 1066.10 with an entry price of 1062.60, resulting in a minor profit (+14.84). The stop-loss is at 1000.00, which is safe, and the invalidation condition is intact. The RSI at 17.929 indicates it is oversold, and the MACD is negative. Given the marginal profit and the bearish indicators, I will **HOLD** the position for now.\n\n5. **DOGE**: Current price is 0.184270 with an entry price of 0.17849, resulting in a profit of about +28.45. The stop-loss is at 0.15, which is safe. The invalidation condition is intact. The RSI at 40.757 indicates a neutral condition, and the MACD is slightly negative. Thus, the decision is to **HOLD** this position as well.\n\nOverall, all current positions are performing adequately and are above their respective stop-loss levels and invalidation conditions. The market indicators suggest a cautious approach, but none of the positions warrant a closure at this time.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 112000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 102000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 102000 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1000.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3600.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3600 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 390.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 10.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 170 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 76.5\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.45,\n      \"risk_usd\": 310.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.2,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.15,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.15 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.4,\n      \"risk_usd\": 170.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, the RSI indicates that the asset is overbought, which could lead to a price correction. Still, since the invalidation condition has not been met and the price is approaching the profit target, I will hold the position for now.\n\n**2.

However, the RSI indicates a high level, suggesting the potential for a reversal. Despite this, the invalidation condition has not been met, and given the upward trend, I will hold the position.\n\n**Conclusion:** Both positions (BTC and SOL) are strong, with no invalidation conditions met.

However, the price is relatively close to the stop-loss level, and the bearish momentum indicates a risk of hitting that stop-loss soon.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Given the current market signals and the proximity of the price to the stop-loss, while the invalidation condition hasn't been triggered yet, the risk of a reversal is significant. I will decide to **hold** the position for now but maintain caution.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 10.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 170 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 76.5\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

This suggests a potential price recovery in the near term.\n   - **MACD**: The MACD is negative (-1.803), indicating bearish momentum, but it is not deeply negative, which could imply some potential for upward movement.\n   - **EMA**: The current price is below the 20-period EMA (187.33), which is typically a bearish sign.\n\n3. **Evaluation Against Invalidation Condition**:\n   - The current price (180.17) is above the stop-loss (170.00) and has not closed below this level on a 3-minute candle. Thus, the position is still valid.\n\n4. **Market Sentiment**:\n   - The overall sentiment appears bearish given the RSI and MACD indicators. However, the oversold condition suggests a possible bounce back.\n\n5. **Risk Management**:\n   - I have a reasonable profit target set at $200.00, which is a good distance from the current price, allowing for potential upward movement while maintaining a stop-loss to limit risk.\n\nBased on the analysis, I will continue to hold the position as the invalidation condition has not been met.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 10.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 200.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 170 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 76.50\n    }\n  }\n}",

I will not initiate a position.\n\nOverall, all indicators across the analyzed cryptocurrencies suggest that they are either overbought or nearing overbought conditions, leading to a decision to abstain from opening any positions at this time.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{}\n```",

However, the MACD shows a downward trend. Therefore, while there is a speculative opportunity to buy, the risk is high due to the lack of upward momentum.\n\n### Ethereum (ETH)\n- **Current Price**: 3978.00\n- **EMA20**: 4072.05 (price is below EMA20)\n- **MACD**: 18.856 (decreasing)\n- **RSI (7-period)**: 11.565 (very oversold)\n\nSimilar to BTC, ETH is below its EMA20 and has a very low RSI, indicating a potential buy opportunity. However, the MACD is also trending down, and the price movement suggests a strong bearish sentiment. \n\n### Solana (SOL)\n- **Current Price**: 194.24\n- **EMA20**: 198.06 (price is below EMA20)\n- **MACD**: 0.526 (decreasing)\n- **RSI (7-period)**: 17.724 (oversold)\n\nThe situation for SOL also mirrors BTC and ETH with the price below the EMA20 and an RSI indicating oversold conditions. The MACD is declining, which presents a risk if entering a long position.\n\n### BNB\n- **Current Price**: 1102.30\n- **EMA20**: 1131.00 (price is below EMA20)\n- **MACD**: 0.816 (decreasing)\n- **RSI (7-period)**: 12.382 (oversold)\n\nBNB presents a similar case with a price below the EMA20 and an extremely low RSI, indicating overselling. The MACD is also declining, which emphasizes caution.\n\n### XRP\n- **Current Price**: 2.60\n- **EMA20**: 2.63 (price is below EMA20)\n- **MACD**: 0.005 (slight decrease)\n- **RSI (7-period)**: 21.015 (oversold)\n\nXRP shares the same characteristics; it's below the EMA20 and has a low RSI, indicating it could be a buying opportunity, but the MACD suggests weaker momentum.\n\n### Dogecoin (DOGE)\n- **Current Price**: 0.193560\n- **EMA20**: 0.199558 (price is below EMA20)\n- **MACD**: -0.000 (flattening)\n- **RSI (7-period)**: 7.266 (very low)\n\nDOGE shows a price below the EMA20 and a very low RSI, suggesting overselling, but the MACD is flat which indicates indecision in market momentum.\n\n### Summary of Analysis\nOverall, all coins show signs of being oversold which might suggest potential buying opportunities.

The stop-loss is set at 110000.00, and the invalidation condition states that if the price closes below 110000 on a 3-minute candle, I should exit. The current price is above the stop-loss, thus I will hold the position. The technical indicators suggest a bearish trend with a current RSI of 16.001, indicating oversold conditions, but the price is still above the stop-loss. Therefore, I will maintain the position.\n\n**ETH**: The current price is 3996.90, with an entry price of 3978.00, resulting in a gain of $42.28. The stop-loss is at 3900.00, and the invalidation condition is the same as BTC, closing below 3900 on a 3-minute candle. The price is above the stop-loss, and the indicators are mixed (RSI at 23.917 indicates oversold, but MACD shows a weak bullish momentum). Considering the current market conditions, I will hold this position as well.\n\n**SOL**: Current price is 193.95, with an entry price of 194.24, resulting in a minor loss of $1.94. The stop-loss is at 190.00, and the invalidation condition is if the price closes below 190 on a 3-minute candle. Since the price is above the stop-loss and the RSI is at 16.824 indicating oversold, maintaining the position is reasonable. Thus, I will hold.\n\n**BNB**: Current price is 1103.70, with an entry price of 1102.30, leading to a minor gain of $0.85. The stop-loss is at 1050.00, and the invalidation condition is if the price closes below 1050 on a 3-minute candle. The price is comfortably above the stop-loss, and with the RSI at 15.992 indicating oversold, I will hold this position as well.\n\n**XRP**: Current price is 2.61, with an entry price of 2.602, indicating a small gain of $0.20. The stop-loss is at 2.50, and the invalidation condition is if the price closes below 2.50 on a 3-minute candle. The current price is above the stop-loss, and the RSI is at 29.076 indicating a potential bullish reversal. I will hold this position.\n\n**DOGE**: Current price is 0.192900, with an entry price of 0.19356, resulting in a minor loss of $0.23. The stop-loss is at 0.18, and the invalidation condition is if the price closes below 0.18 on a 3-minute candle. The current price is above the stop-loss, but the RSI of 6.467 indicates extreme oversold conditions. I will hold this position too.\n\nIn summary, all positions are currently above their stop-loss levels, and market indicators suggest that holding these positions is prudent.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 115000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 110000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 110000 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 864.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4100.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3900.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3900 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 195.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 205.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 190.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 190 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 26.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1150.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1050.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1050 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 52.3\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 50.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.8,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.50 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 25.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 300.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.2,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.18,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.18 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 45.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "# CHAIN OF THOUGHT\n\n**BTC**: \nCurrent price is 113569.00, with an entry price of 112864.00. The position is currently up by approximately $64.86. The stop-loss is set at 110000.00, and the invalidation condition states that a close below 110000 on a 3-minute candle will trigger a sell. The current MACD (341.506) shows bullish momentum, while the RSI (50.544) indicates a neutral market condition. The price is above the 20 EMA (113523.89), suggesting a potential uptrend. Therefore, the decision is to **hold** as the invalidation condition is not met and the market indicators are supportive.\n\n**ETH**: \nCurrent price is 4022.80, with an entry price of 3978.00, resulting in an unrealized profit of about $107.03. The stop-loss is at 3900.00, and the invalidation condition states that a close below 3900 on a 3-minute candle will trigger a sell. The MACD (11.095) is slightly positive, suggesting weak bullish momentum, while the RSI (39.414) indicates a bearish trend. Given that the price is near the EMA (4057.38) and approaching the stop-loss, I will **hold**, as the invalidation condition is not met yet.\n\n**SOL**: \nThe current price is 195.67, with an entry price of 194.24, resulting in a slight unrealized profit of around $6.66. The stop-loss is set at 190.00, and the invalidation condition states that a close below 190 on a 3-minute candle will trigger a sell. The MACD (0.241) is slightly positive, but the RSI (40.842) indicates a weak bullish momentum. The price is below the EMA (197.29), which is a bearish signal. However, since the stop-loss has not been hit, I will **hold** the position.\n\n**BNB**: \nCurrent price is 1116.60, with an entry price of 1102.30, resulting in an unrealized profit of about $13.75. The stop-loss is at 1050.00, and the invalidation condition states that a close below 1050 on a 3-minute candle will trigger a sell. The MACD (-2.257) indicates bearish momentum, and the RSI (44.246) suggests a neutral market condition. Since there is potential bearish pressure and the price is below EMA (1127.40), I will choose to **hold** as the invalidation condition has not been met yet.\n\n**XRP**: \nCurrent price is 2.63, with an entry price of 2.602, resulting in a slight unrealized profit of approximately $1.51. The stop-loss is at 2.50, and the invalidation condition states that a close below 2.50 on a 3-minute candle will trigger a sell. The current MACD (0.003) and RSI (57.614) indicate a neutral trend. The price is at the EMA (2.63). Given the lack of strong momentum and the proximity to the stop-loss, I will **hold** as the invalidation condition is not met.\n\n**DOGE**: \nCurrent price is 0.194270, with an entry price of 0.19356, resulting in a minor unrealized profit of about $0.18. The stop-loss is at 0.18, and the invalidation condition states that a close below 0.18 on a 3-minute candle will trigger a sell. The MACD (-0.001) suggests bearish momentum, and the RSI (28.413) indicates oversold conditions. Given the proximity to the stop-loss and lack of bullish signals, I will **hold** as the invalidation condition has not been met.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 115000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 110000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 110000 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 864.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4100.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3900.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3900 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 195.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 205.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 190.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 190 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 26.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1150.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1050.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1050 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 52.3\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 50.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.8,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.50 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 25.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 300.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.2,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.18,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.18 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 45.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The stop-loss is set at 110000.00, while the invalidation condition is triggered if the price closes below 110000 on a 3-minute candle. The RSI is at 21.452, indicating oversold conditions, and the MACD is negative, suggesting bearish momentum. Since the current price is close to the stop-loss and invalidation condition is not met yet, I will **hold** this position.\n\n2. **ETH**: Current price is 3949.50, and the entry price is 3978.00. The current unrealized PnL is -76.22. The stop-loss is set at 3900.00, and the invalidation condition is if the price closes below 3900 on a 3-minute candle. The RSI is at 19.701, showing oversold conditions, and MACD is also negative. The price is nearing the stop-loss level, but has not yet triggered the invalidation condition. I will **hold** this position as well since it hasn't hit the stop-loss yet.\n\n3. **SOL**: Current price is 196.76, with an entry price of 194.24. The position is slightly in profit, with unrealized PnL of $12.11. The stop-loss is set at 190.00 and the invalidation is if the price closes below 190 on a 3-minute candle. RSI is at 47.842 and MACD is negative but not strong. Since the position is in profit and not close to the stop-loss, I will **hold** this position.\n\n4. **BNB**: Current price is 1098.90, with an entry price of 1102.30. The unrealized PnL is -3.95. The stop-loss is set at 1050.00, and the invalidation condition is if the price closes below 1050 on a 3-minute candle. The RSI is at 24.728, indicating oversold conditions. Since this position is close to the stop-loss, I will **hold** it for now, as the invalidation condition hasn't been triggered yet.\n\n5. **XRP**: Current price is 2.62, with an entry price of 2.602. The unrealized PnL is $1.07. The stop-loss is set at 2.50, and the invalidation is if the price closes below 2.50 on a 3-minute candle. The RSI is at 45.002, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold significantly. As it is slightly profitable and above the stop-loss, I will **hold** this position.\n\n6. **DOGE**: Current price is 0.190980, entry price is 0.19356. The unrealized PnL is -0.80. The stop-loss is set at 0.18, and the invalidation condition is if the price closes below 0.18 on a 3-minute candle. The RSI is low at 20.293, indicating oversold conditions. As the price is nearing the stop-loss, I will **hold** this position.\n\nAll positions are currently managed within their risk parameters, and none have hit their stop-loss or invalidation conditions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 115000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 110000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 110000 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 864.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4100.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3900.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3900 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 195.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 205.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 190.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 190 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 26.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1150.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1050.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1050 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 52.3\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 50.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.8,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.5,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.50 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 25.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 300.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.2,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.18,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.18 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 45.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The RSI indicates oversold conditions, which can suggest a potential reversal, but the MACD is indicating strong bearish momentum. Since the price is close to the stop-loss and the invalidation condition is imminent, I will close this position to mitigate losses.\n\n### ETH\n- **Current Price**: 3903.30, **Entry Price**: 3978.00\n- **Stop-Loss**: 3900.00, **Profit Target**: 4100.00\n- **Invalidation Condition**: If price closes below 3900 on a 3-minute candle\n- **Current RSI**: 13.637 (indicates oversold conditions)\n- **Current MACD**: -37.182 (indicates bearish momentum)\n- The current price is below the entry price and near the stop-loss. The ETH position is also under significant pressure, with the RSI showing oversold conditions. However, it has not yet hit the stop-loss. Thus, I will close this position to prevent further losses.\n\n### SOL\n- **Current Price**: 192.75, **Entry Price**: 194.24\n- **Stop-Loss**: 190.00, **Profit Target**: 205.00\n- **Invalidation Condition**: If price closes below 190 on a 3-minute candle\n- **Current RSI**: 28.319 (indicates a weak momentum)\n- **Current MACD**: -1.235 (indicates bearish momentum)\n- The price is below the entry price and close to the stop-loss. Given the overall negative market sentiment reflected in the RSI and MACD, I will close this position as well to avoid hitting my stop-loss.\n\n### BNB\n- **Current Price**: 1106.70, **Entry Price**: 1102.30\n- **Stop-Loss**: 1050.00, **Profit Target**: 1150.00\n- **Invalidation Condition**: If price closes below 1050 on a 3-minute candle\n- **Current RSI**: 40.811 (neutral)\n- **Current MACD**: -8.239 (shows bearish but weakening momentum)\n- The position is slightly in profit but lacks significant bullish momentum. However, it is not near the stop-loss and the conditions do not warrant an exit at this time. I will hold this position as the invalidation condition has not been met.\n\n### XRP\n- **Current Price**: 2.59, **Entry Price**: 2.602\n- **Stop-Loss**: 2.50, **Profit Target**: 2.80\n- **Invalidation Condition**: If price closes below 2.50 on a 3-minute candle\n- **Current RSI**: 26.018 (indicates oversold)\n- **Current MACD**: -0.006 (shows weak bearish momentum)\n- The XRP position is slightly negative, but the invalidation condition hasn\u2019t been triggered. Given the oversold condition of the RSI, I will hold this position for potential recovery.\n\n### DOGE\n- **Current Price**: 0.193870, **Entry Price**: 0.193560\n- **Stop-Loss**: 0.18, **Profit Target**: 0.20\n- **Invalidation Condition**: If price closes below 0.18 on a 3-minute candle\n- **Current RSI**: 45.285 (neutral)\n- **Current MACD**: -0.003 (indicates weak bearish momentum)\n- The DOGE position is slightly in profit and not near the stop-loss.

Instead, I will analyze the current market conditions and decide whether to initiate new trades based on the available data.\n\n### BTC Analysis\n- **Current Price**: 109241.00\n- **EMA20**: 110946.48 (price is below EMA)\n- **MACD**: -1476.120 (indicating bearish momentum)\n- **RSI (7)**: 51.575 (neutral, not overbought or oversold)\n\nGiven that BTC is below the EMA20 and the MACD is negative, this indicates a potential downtrend. The current price is also lower than previous significant levels, suggesting resistance above.\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- **Current Price**: 3828.40\n- **EMA20**: 3927.86 (price is below EMA)\n- **MACD**: -80.735 (bearish momentum)\n- **RSI (7)**: 49.124 (neutral)\n\nSimilar to BTC, ETH is below its EMA20 and has a negative MACD. This suggests bearish sentiment in the market, and the lack of bullish signals does not justify entering a position.\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- **Current Price**: 185.12\n- **EMA20**: 192.16 (price is below EMA)\n- **MACD**: -3.518 (bearish)\n- **RSI (7)**: 40.069 (neutral)\n\nSOL is in a similar situation with bearish indicators. The price is below the EMA, and the MACD is negative, suggesting a continued downward trend.\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- **Current Price**: 1085.40\n- **EMA20**: 1105.36 (price is below EMA)\n- **MACD**: -13.678 (bearish)\n- **RSI (7)**: 46.006 (neutral)\n\nBNB's metrics show a bearish trend with the price below EMA20 and negative MACD, indicating no entry opportunity.\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- **Current Price**: 2.47\n- **EMA20**: 2.55 (price is below EMA)\n- **MACD**: -0.047 (bearish)\n- **RSI (7)**: 44.415 (neutral)\n\nAgain, XRP shows a bearish trend, making it unwise to enter a position.\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- **Current Price**: 0.184400\n- **EMA20**: 0.190549 (price is below EMA)\n- **MACD**: -0.004 (bearish)\n- **RSI (7)**: 47.165 (neutral)\n\nDOGE is also showing a bearish trend, similar to the other assets.\n\nIn conclusion, considering all the analyses above, there are no favorable conditions to open any new positions. Therefore, no trades will be initiated.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{}\n```",
