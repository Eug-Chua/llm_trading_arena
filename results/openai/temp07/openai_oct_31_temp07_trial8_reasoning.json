The position is currently showing a profit with unrealized P&L of $149.116. The stop-loss is set at 104500.00, and the profit target is 110000.00. The invalidation condition is if the price closes below 104500.00 on a 3-minute candle. The current price is above the stop-loss and invalidation level, and the RSI is at 58.548, indicating potential upward momentum. However, the MACD is negative at -861.916, suggesting bearish momentum. Decision: **HOLD** - as the invalidation condition has not been met.\n\n2. **SOL**: Current price is 186.90, with an entry price of 181.47. The unrealized P&L is $26.696, with a stop-loss at 175.00 and a profit target of 195.00. The invalidation condition is if the price closes below 175.00 on a 3-minute candle. The current price remains above the stop-loss, and the RSI is at 62.603, indicating a relatively strong position but nearing overbought territory. The MACD is also negative at -1.537, which could indicate potential weakness. Decision: **HOLD** - as the invalidation condition has not been met.\n\n3. **XRP**: Current price is 2.3673, with an entry price of 2.2812. The unrealized P&L is $84.959, with a stop-loss at 2.20 and a profit target of 2.50. The invalidation condition is if the price closes below 2.20 on a 3-minute candle. The current price is above both the stop-loss and invalidation level. The RSI is at 62.833, which suggests a robust position, but the MACD is negative at -0.009. Decision: **HOLD** - as the invalidation condition has not been met.\n\n4. **DOGE**: Current price is 0.190530, with an entry price of 0.18261. The current unrealized P&L is $39.143, with a stop-loss at 0.17 and a profit target of 0.20. The invalidation condition is if the price closes below 0.17 on a 3-minute candle. The current price is above the stop-loss and invalidation level. The RSI is at 79.484, indicating potential overbought conditions, while the MACD is slightly negative at -0.001. Decision: **HOLD** - as the invalidation condition has not been met.\n\nOverall, the positions are above their respective stop-loss and invalidation levels, and while some indicators suggest caution, none of the invalidation conditions have been met.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 110000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 104500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 104500 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1170.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 175.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 175 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 32.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.5,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.2,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.20 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 80.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.2,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.17,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.17 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 25.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, since the invalidation condition has not been met, and the price is still above the stop-loss, I will hold the position.\n\n2. **XRP**:\n   - Current Price: 2.3739\n   - Entry Price: 2.2812\n   - Profit Target: 2.50\n   - Stop Loss: 2.20\n   - Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 2.20 on 3-minute candle\n\n   The current price is significantly above the entry price and has been gaining.

The RSI is quite high at 77.432, indicating overbought conditions. However, since the invalidation condition has not been triggered, I will maintain this position.\n\nIn summary, for all positions, the current market state does not trigger any exit conditions, and I will continue to hold all of them. I will monitor the market closely for any changes in the invalidation conditions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 175.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 175 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 32.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.5,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.2,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.20 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 80.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.20,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.17,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.17 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 25.0\n    }\n  }\n}",

The invalidation condition has not been met since the price is above 175. The RSI of 79.759 indicates the asset is overbought, but the upward trend could continue. Given the position is profitable and the invalidation condition is not met, I will hold this position.\n\n2. **XRP Position:**\n   - Current Price: 2.40, Entry Price: 2.2812\n   - Profit Target: 2.50, Stop Loss: 2.20\n   - Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 2.20 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - The current price is also above both the entry price and stop loss. The invalidation condition remains intact as the price is above 2.20. The RSI of 74.174 suggests a relatively high level but not excessively so. The position is profitable, and I will hold it.\n\n3. **DOGE Position:**\n   - Current Price: 0.19644, Entry Price: 0.18261\n   - Profit Target: 0.20, Stop Loss: 0.17\n   - Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 0.17 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - The DOGE position is also in profit, well above the entry price and the stop loss. The invalidation condition has not been triggered as the price is above 0.17. The RSI of 85.112 indicates it is overbought, suggesting caution, but since the position is still profitable, I will hold.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll positions are currently profitable, and none have triggered their respective invalidation conditions. Therefore, I will maintain all positions and hold them for the time being.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 175.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 175 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 32.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.5,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.2,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.20 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 80.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.20,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.17,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.17 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 25.0\n    }\n  }\n}",

I will not open new positions in other coins since I currently have no positions in them.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 175.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 175 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 32.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.20,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.20 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 80.0\n    }\n  }\n}",

This suggests a potential for a pullback.\n   - **MACD:** The MACD reading of 778.263 indicates strong upward momentum, and while the RSI suggests overbought conditions, the MACD supports the bullish trend.\n  \n3. **Risk Management:** The stop-loss is set at 109000, providing a cushion against a significant downturn. The invalidation condition is also aligned with risk management strategies. As long as the price doesn\u2019t close below 109000, the position remains valid.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Given the strong price action and the fact that the invalidation condition has not been met, I will continue to hold my position.

The RSI is at 34.819, indicating that BTC is in a potentially oversold condition, which could suggest a rebound. However, the MACD is declining, indicating bearish momentum. The price is currently moving away from the EMA20, which is also a bearish signal.

However, the price is below the EMA and the trend is bearish.
