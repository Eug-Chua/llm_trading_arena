After careful consideration, I will opt to enter a buy position in XRP with a conservative approach.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1000,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.55,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.25,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.35 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 130.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Thus, I need to analyze the market conditions and identify potential buy opportunities based on the available data.\n\n### BTC Analysis\n- **Current Price**: $107062.00\n- **EMA20**: $107953.90 indicates a downtrend.\n- **MACD**: -1001.529 is bearish, indicating potential downward momentum.\n- **RSI (7-period)**: 52.579 suggests neutrality, but it is not strongly bullish.\n- **Invalidation Condition**: A solid invalidation level would be a close below the last significant support around $106000. The lack of upward momentum and the bearish MACD indicate that initiating a buy position here is risky.\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- **Current Price**: $3892.20\n- **EMA20**: $3892.32 is slightly above the current price, showing a weak downtrend.\n- **MACD**: -26.781 suggests bearish momentum.\n- **RSI (7-period)**: 65.827 indicates a potential overbought condition.\n- **Invalidation Condition**: A close below $3875 could trigger a bearish signal. The proximity to the EMA20 and the overbought RSI suggest hesitation in entering a buy position.\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- **Current Price**: $186.28\n- **EMA20**: $187.20 indicates resistance.\n- **MACD**: -2.703 is bearish.\n- **RSI (7-period)**: 63.096 suggests approaching overbought.\n- **Invalidation Condition**: A close below $185 could signal a strong downtrend. The market conditions don't warrant a buy here as it is near resistance.\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- **Current Price**: $1102.30\n- **EMA20**: $1115.73 indicates a downtrend.\n- **MACD**: -19.039 is bearish.\n- **RSI (7-period)**: 55.026 shows neutrality.\n- **Invalidation Condition**: A close below $1080 would indicate a reversal. No buy signal is warranted given the current trends.\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- **Current Price**: $2.37\n- **EMA20**: $2.36 shows slight bullishness.\n- **MACD**: -0.018 is nearly neutral but suggests bearish momentum.\n- **RSI (7-period)**: 63.209 indicates potential overbought conditions.\n- **Invalidation Condition**: Close below $2.30 could confirm bearish sentiment. A buy position is not justified here.\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- **Current Price**: $0.189270\n- **EMA20**: $0.189425 is slightly above current price.\n- **MACD**: -0.003 indicates a neutral trend.\n- **RSI (7-period)**: 71.254 indicates overbought conditions, suggesting a potential reversal.\n- **Invalidation Condition**: A close below $0.185 would indicate a strong bearish signal. No buy position recommended.\n\nOverall, while the market exhibits some areas of interest, all coins show either bearish trends or overbought conditions, making it prudent to refrain from entering new positions at this time.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"No existing position to close\",\n      \"leverage\": 0,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"No position available\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"No existing position to close\",\n      \"leverage\": 0,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"No position available\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"No existing position to close\",\n      \"leverage\": 0,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"No position available\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"No existing position to close\",\n      \"leverage\": 0,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"No position available\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"No existing position to close\",\n      \"leverage\": 0,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"No position available\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"No existing position to close\",\n      \"leverage\": 0,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"No position available\"\n    }\n  }\n}",

However, the RSI indicates that the asset is overbought, which could signal a potential pullback. Since the invalidation condition has not been met (price is above 106000), I will hold this position as it is still favorable, with the potential to reach the profit target soon.\n\n### XRP Position Analysis\n- **Current Price:** 2.3976\n- **Entry Price:** 2.3673\n- **Profit Target:** 2.45\n- **Stop-Loss:** 2.30\n- **Invalidation Condition:** If price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle.\n- **RSI:** 72.100 (overbought)\n- **MACD:** 0.012 (neutral)\n- **EMA Trend:** The current EMA20 is 2.35, slightly above the price indicating a bullish trend.\n\n**Analysis:** XRP is also showing an upward movement with a decent profit potential. However, similar to BTC, the RSI indicates overbought conditions. The invalidation condition hasn't been triggered, so I will choose to hold this position for potential further gains up to the profit target.\n\n### Summary\nBoth positions in BTC and XRP are currently above their respective entry prices and the invalidation conditions have not been met.

Therefore, I will analyze the market conditions for BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP, and DOGE to determine the best opportunities for opening new positions.\n\n**BTC:**\n- Current Price: $111,161.00\n- EMA20: $108,296.93 (uptrend)\n- MACD: 341.853 (bullish)\n- RSI (7 periods): 91.207 (overbought)\n\nThe current indicators suggest a strong upward trend, but the RSI indicates that Bitcoin is overbought. Given the price is significantly above the EMA20, it might be prudent to wait for a pullback before considering a buy.\n\n**ETH:**\n- Current Price: $4,053.40\n- EMA20: $3,935.02 (uptrend)\n- MACD: 29.089 (bullish)\n- RSI (7 periods): 92.913 (overbought)\n\nSimilar to BTC, Ethereum shows a strong upward trend, but is also in the overbought territory. This suggests that a pullback might be likely before a new entry should be considered.\n\n**SOL:**\n- Current Price: $192.93\n- EMA20: $187.63 (uptrend)\n- MACD: 1.318 (bullish)\n- RSI (7 periods): 77.159 (approaching overbought)\n\nSOL is also in an uptrend and nearing the overbought threshold. While it is not as extreme as BTC and ETH, caution is warranted.\n\n**BNB:**\n- Current Price: $1,124.50\n- EMA20: $1,110.57 (uptrend)\n- MACD: -2.830 (bearish)\n- RSI (7 periods): 67.344 (not overbought)\n\nBNB shows a weaker upward momentum with the MACD in bearish territory. Given its current position and indicators, it is not an ideal candidate for a buy.\n\n**XRP:**\n- Current Price: $2.47\n- EMA20: $2.38 (uptrend)\n- MACD: 0.022 (slightly bullish)\n- RSI (7 periods): 87.651 (overbought)\n\nXRP is in a strong uptrend but is also overbought. Similar to BTC and ETH, it may face a pullback soon.\n\n**DOGE:**\n- Current Price: $0.201150\n- EMA20: $0.192302 (uptrend)\n- MACD: 0.003 (neutral)\n- RSI (7 periods): 86.119 (overbought)\n\nDOGE is also highly overbought and carries neutral momentum. Like the others, it would be wise to wait for a better entry point.\n\nIn summary, while all major cryptocurrencies are in an uptrend, the high RSI values across the board suggest that entering positions now could lead to short-term losses if a corrective pullback occurs.

However, the RSI is at 85.817, indicating overbought conditions, and the MACD is strong but could indicate reversal soon. The EMA is trending upwards, but given the high RSI, I would consider closing this position to manage risk. \n\n2. **ETH**: \n   - Current price: 4033.50, Entry price: 4053.40. \n   - Unrealized PnL: -54.82.\n   - Stop-loss: 3900.00, Profit target: 4350.00.\n   - Invalidation condition: If price closes below 3900 on 3-minute candle.\n   - The current price is above the stop-loss and invalidation condition. The RSI is elevated at 74.557, indicating potential overbought conditions, but not excessively so. MACD is moderately positive. Given that the price is close to the entry, I will hold as conditions aren't dire yet.\n\n3. **SOL**: \n   - Current price: 192.11, Entry price: 192.93.\n   - Unrealized PnL: -4.58.\n   - Stop-loss: 185.00, Profit target: 210.00.\n   - Invalidation condition: If price closes below 185.00 on 3-minute candle.\n   - The current price is still above the stop-loss and invalidation condition, and the RSI is at 68.036, still in a reasonable range. MACD shows a slight upward trend. I will hold this position for now.\n\n4. **XRP**: \n   - Current price: 2.46, Entry price: 2.4688.\n   - Unrealized PnL: -0.29.\n   - Stop-loss: 2.30, Profit target: 2.70.\n   - Invalidation condition: If price closes below 2.30 on 3-minute candle.\n   - The price is above both stop-loss and invalidation levels. The RSI indicates an overbought condition at 75.136. I will hold since it hasn't hit invalidation yet.\n\n5. **DOGE**: \n   - Current price: 0.20019, Entry price: 0.20115.\n   - Unrealized PnL: -1.06. \n   - Stop-loss: 0.19, Profit target: 0.22.\n   - Invalidation condition: If price closes below 0.19 on 3-minute candle.\n   - The current price is still above the stop-loss. However, the RSI is at 75.675, indicating overbought conditions as well. I will hold this position cautiously.\n\nGiven the current conditions, I will close the BTC position due to overbought signals and hold the others, as they are still within acceptable limits.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 117000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 108000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 108000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1161.0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Overbought conditions indicated by RSI and nearing invalidation.\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4350.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3900.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3900 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 383.5\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 210.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 185.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 185.00 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 39.65\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 20.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.70,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.30,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.30 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 3.4\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.22,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.19,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.19 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 20.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Given the upward momentum, I will hold this position.\n\n### DOGE\n- **Current Position**: Holding 1000 DOGE at an entry price of 0.20115, current price 0.19995.\n- **Performance**: Unrealized PnL is -$1.30.\n- **Exit Plan**: Profit target at 0.22, stop-loss at 0.19.\n- **Invalidation Condition**: If price closes below 0.19 on a 3-minute candle.\n- **Technical Indicators**: \n  - RSI (7) at 70.002 is indicating overbought conditions.\n  - The price is slightly above the EMA20, indicating a potential bullish trend.\n- **Analysis**: The price is close to the stop-loss but hasn't reached the invalidation condition yet.

The RSI suggests there is potential for a rebound, but the trend is uncertain. Given the current price's proximity to the stop-loss, I will continue to monitor closely, but for now, I will **hold** this position.\n\n#### DOGE\n- **Current Price**: 0.19416, **Entry Price**: 0.20115\n- **Stop-Loss**: 0.19, **Profit Target**: 0.22\n- **Invalidation Condition**: If price closes below 0.19 on a 3-minute candle.\n- **Current RSI (7 period)**: 22.808, indicating oversold conditions.\n- **Current MACD**: 0.003, showing very little momentum.\n- Like XRP, the price here is also below entry and nearing the stop-loss.

The RSI at 58.69 is neutral, suggesting there is still room for the price to rise. The MACD is also positive, indicating bullish momentum.\n   - **Decision**: **HOLD** - No exit conditions met, as the invalidation condition has not been triggered.\n\n2. **DOGE**: \n   - **Current Price**: 0.20149\n   - **Entry Price**: 0.20115\n   - **Stop-Loss**: 0.19\n   - **Profit Target**: 0.22\n   - **Invalidation Condition**: If price closes below 0.19 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - **Technical Analysis**: The current price is above entry and stop-loss, showing a slight profit.

Given the bullish indicators but high RSI, I will maintain my position but will closely monitor for any signs of reversal.\n\nDecision: **HOLD** - No exit conditions are met, and I will continue to ride this upward momentum while being cautious of potential overbought corrections.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 113000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 107000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 107500 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 128.9\n    }\n  }\n}",

Therefore, I need to analyze the market conditions to determine if I should enter any new positions.\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 110102.00\n- The price is below the 20-period EMA (113027.14), indicating a bearish trend.\n- The MACD is negative (-711.987), suggesting downward momentum.\n- The RSI (7-period) is extremely low at 13.152, which indicates that BTC is oversold, but given the other indicators, caution is warranted.\n- No significant support levels are in sight, and the trend is currently downwards.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 3902.00\n- The price is below the 20-period EMA (4032.45), indicating a bearish trend.\n- The MACD is negative (-42.487), indicating bearish momentum.\n- The RSI (7-period) is very low at 13.487, indicating oversold conditions, but again, caution is required as the trend remains bearish.\n- The price is approaching potential support around 3900, but the overall trend is down.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 193.99\n- The price is below the 20-period EMA (197.29), indicating a bearish trend.\n- The MACD is negative (-1.258), confirming downward momentum.\n- The RSI (7-period) is 38.638, indicating that it is not oversold but also not strong enough for a bullish reversal.\n- The price is near recent lows, but a clear trend reversal signal has not yet appeared.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 1107.20\n- The price is below the 20-period EMA (1121.28), confirming a bearish trend.\n- The MACD is negative (-7.183), which suggests continued downward pressure.\n- The RSI (7-period) is 41.918, indicating that the asset is neither oversold nor overbought.\n- There are no clear reversal signals present.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 2.55\n- The price is below the 20-period EMA (2.62), indicating a bearish trend.\n- The MACD is slightly negative (-0.007), showing weak bearish momentum.\n- The RSI (7-period) is 16.840, indicating oversold conditions, but the bearish trend remains a concern.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 0.192270\n- The price is below the 20-period EMA (0.197204), indicating a bearish trend.\n- The MACD is negative (-0.003), suggesting downward momentum.\n- The RSI (7-period) is 36.784, which indicates that it is nearing oversold territory.\n- The price is near recent lows, but no strong buy signal is present.\n\nGiven the analysis above, all cryptocurrencies are in a bearish trend with low RSI values indicating oversold conditions. However, the overall market sentiment does not show any strong signals for a reversal, and initiating new positions might be risky.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 115000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 108000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 108000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.60,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1100.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4100.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3800.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3800 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 250.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The RSI is under 50, indicating bearish momentum. The invalidation condition hasn't triggered yet, so I will hold.\n\n**XRP Position:**\n- Current Price: 2.44, Entry Price: 2.4523\n- Profit Target: 2.70, Stop-Loss: 2.30\n- Invalidation Condition: If price closes above 2.60 on a 3-minute candle\n- Current EMA20: 2.56, Current MACD: -0.052, Current RSI (7-period): 32.819\n- Analysis: XRP is currently below the entry price.

However, the indicators suggest weak momentum, with the RSI below 50 and the MACD neutral. The invalidation condition has not triggered, so I will hold this position.\n\nOverall, while current market conditions across all positions are bearish, none of the invalidation conditions have been met. Therefore, I will hold all positions for now.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 112500.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 104000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes above 112150 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.4,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1750.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 4000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3500.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes above 3989 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.4,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 175.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes above 195.50 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.4,\n      \"risk_usd\": 50.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1150.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1050.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes above 1122.00 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.4,\n      \"risk_usd\": 50.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 20.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.7,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.3,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes above 2.60 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.4,\n      \"risk_usd\": 50.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 500.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.2,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.17,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes above 0.194 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.4,\n      \"risk_usd\": 50.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
