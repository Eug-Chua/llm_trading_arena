      "raw_response": "# CHAIN OF THOUGHT\n\nCurrently, there are no open positions in any of the cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE). As a result, I need to assess the current market conditions to determine if it is prudent to open any new positions.\n\n1. **BTC**: The current price is $108,565. The 20-period EMA is $108,796.72, indicating a slight downtrend as the current price is below the EMA. The MACD shows a value of 651.383, which suggests bullish momentum, but the RSI is 33.958, indicating that BTC is nearing oversold territory. The lack of bullish signals and the downward trend suggest that opening a position in BTC may not be favorable at this moment.\n\n2. **ETH**: The current price is $3,890.10, significantly below the 20-period EMA of $3,942.75. The MACD at 9.138 is showing positive momentum, but the RSI at 14.200 suggests that ETH is oversold. Although there is potential for a rebound, the price action is not strong enough to justify entering a long position.\n\n3. **SOL**: The current price is $186.17, also below the 20-period EMA of $187.90. The MACD is at 0.151, indicating weak bullish momentum, and the RSI of 37.101 is still below the neutral 50 level. Given these indicators, entering a position in SOL does not seem advisable.\n\n4. **BNB**: The current price is $1,076.10, with a 20-period EMA of $1,100.85 indicating a downtrend. The MACD reading of -7.363 and an RSI of 23.919 both point to bearish momentum and oversold conditions, suggesting that BNB is currently weak.\n\n5. **XRP**: The price of XRP is $2.43, just above its EMA of $2.42. The MACD at 0.026 shows very weak bullish momentum, and the RSI at 38.327 is not strong enough to indicate a buy signal. Therefore, it is not a favorable time to enter a position in XRP.\n\n6. **DOGE**: The current price is $0.194430 against an EMA of $0.194846. The MACD is very close to zero at 0.002, and the RSI is at 26.377, indicating that DOGE is oversold. However, the lack of upward momentum suggests that this is not a good entry point for a trade.\n\nIn summary, the technical indicators across all coins show that the market is generally weak, and there are no clear buy signals. Due to the absence of open positions and unfavorable market conditions, there is no reason to initiate a new trade.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"No positions to close\",\n      \"leverage\": 0,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"No open positions\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"No positions to close\",\n      \"leverage\": 0,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"No open positions\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"No positions to close\",\n      \"leverage\": 0,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"No open positions\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"No positions to close\",\n      \"leverage\": 0,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"No open positions\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"No positions to close\",\n      \"leverage\": 0,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"No open positions\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"No positions to close\",\n      \"leverage\": 0,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"No open positions\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, the RSI is quite high at 79.902, indicating potential overbought conditions. The lack of open interest suggests that this could be a risky entry point.\n\n### ETH\n- **Current Price**: 4082.90, **EMA20**: 3954.66\n- **MACD**: 21.240, **RSI (7)**: 78.068\n- **Analysis**: ETH also shows strong momentum above the EMA20. The RSI is near overbought levels, but the MACD is positive, indicating a continuation of the trend. Similar to BTC, the lack of open interest presents a risk.\n\n### SOL\n- **Current Price**: 196.14, **EMA20**: 188.66\n- **MACD**: 0.823, **RSI (7)**: 79.495\n- **Analysis**: SOL is performing well, with the price above the EMA20 and a high RSI indicating it is nearing overbought territory. The MACD is positive, but again, the risk is elevated due to the high RSI and no open interest.\n\n### BNB\n- **Current Price**: 1111.50, **EMA20**: 1099.82\n- **MACD**: -2.844, **RSI (7)**: 68.270\n- **Analysis**: BNB is relatively stable, but the negative MACD indicates weakness compared to other coins. The RSI suggests there is still room for movement, but it is not as strong as BTC or ETH.\n\n### XRP\n- **Current Price**: 2.52, **EMA20**: 2.43\n- **MACD**: 0.027, **RSI (7)**: 72.690\n- **Analysis**: XRP shows some bullish characteristics, with the price above the EMA and a moderate RSI. The MACD is not particularly strong, but it may present a safer entry point.\n\n### DOGE\n- **Current Price**: 0.204240, **EMA20**: 0.195765\n- **MACD**: 0.003, **RSI (7)**: 77.494\n- **Analysis**: DOGE has a high RSI suggesting it may be overbought, although its MACD is neutral. This coin may not be the best candidate for a new position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the analysis, I will consider entering positions in BTC and ETH, where the momentum is strong despite high RSI levels. The other coins do not present compelling enough conditions for entry.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.05,\n      \"profit_target\": 116000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 110000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 110000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 693.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.00,\n      \"profit_target\": 4200.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3950.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3950 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.60,\n      \"risk_usd\": 265.80\n    }\n  }\n}\n``` \n\nThis analysis and trading decision consider the current market conditions and potential risks associated with the high RSI readings.",

However, with an RSI above 70, there is a risk of a price correction. The MACD is negative, which suggests a potential bearish divergence. Given the bullish price action, I will hold this position but will monitor closely due to overbought conditions.\n\n### ETH Position\n- **Current Price**: 3877.10\n- **Entry Price**: 3825.10\n- **Stop-Loss**: 3750.00\n- **Profit Target**: 3900.00\n- **Invalidation Condition**: If price closes below 3750 on a 3-minute candle\n- **Current RSI**: 61.526 (not in overbought territory)\n- **Current MACD**: -42.810 (bearish signal)\n- **EMA Trend**: Current EMA20 (3897.90) is just below the price.\n\nThe current price is above the entry price and the stop-loss. The invalidation condition has not been met, and the RSI indicates that the asset isn\u2019t overbought. However, the MACD is negative, which could suggest weakness. Given these factors, I will also hold this position, monitoring for any changes.\n\n### XRP Position\n- **Current Price**: 2.4071\n- **Entry Price**: 2.3781\n- **Stop-Loss**: 2.3000\n- **Profit Target**: 2.5000\n- **Invalidation Condition**: If price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\n- **Current RSI**: 58.104 (neutral)\n- **Current MACD**: -0.018 (bearish signal)\n- **EMA Trend**: Current EMA20 (2.42) is slightly above the current price.\n\nThis position is also above the entry price and stop-loss, with the invalidation condition not met. The RSI is neutral, indicating no immediate overbought or oversold conditions, but the MACD suggests some bearishness. Therefore, I will hold this position as well.\n\n## TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 110000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 107000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 107000 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 137.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 3900.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3750.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3750 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 187.5\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 50.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.5,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.3,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 4.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The MACD shows a strong momentum (685.372), but the high RSI indicates a potential reversal soon. Given this overbought condition, I would avoid entering a new position at this time.\n\n2. **ETH**: The price is $4,045.20, with an EMA20 of $3,933.26 and an RSI of 85.973, which also indicates overbought conditions. The MACD (25.097) shows a positive trend. Similar to BTC, the overbought status suggests caution against entering a new position.\n\n3. **SOL**: The current price is $197.78, with an EMA20 of $192.41 and an RSI of 81.663. This indicates a strong upward momentum but also an overbought situation. The MACD is positive (1.709), suggesting further upward movement, but the RSI indicates potential risk.\n\n4. **BNB**: Currently priced at $1,135.10 with an EMA20 of $1,116.54 and an RSI of 86.271, which is extremely high. The MACD is also positive (2.783), but the RSI indicates a strong likelihood of a bearish reversal soon.\n\n5. **XRP**: The price is $2.65 with an EMA20 of $2.53 and an RSI of 94.001, which is exceptionally high, indicating a severe overbought situation. The MACD is at 0.056, showing minimal momentum. This is a clear sign to avoid entering a position.\n\n6. **DOGE**: Priced at $0.201760, with an EMA20 of $0.196547 and an RSI of 80.480.

There is a slight unrealized loss of approximately **$7.69**.\n   - The stop-loss is set at **111000.00** and the profit target is **118000.00**. The invalidation condition states that if the price closes below **111000.00** on a 3-minute candle, we should exit.\n   - The current price is still above the stop-loss and invalidation level, so I will hold this position as the overall trend is still strong with a high MACD and RSI at **84.446** indicating overbought conditions, but no immediate reversal signals.\n\n2. **ETH Position**:\n   - Current price is **4067.30**, entry price is **4074.90**, leading to an unrealized loss of about **$19.27**.\n   - The stop-loss is at **3900.00** and the profit target is at **4300.00**. The invalidation condition is a close below **3900.00**.\n   - Similar to BTC, the price remains well above the stop-loss and invalidation level. However, the RSI at **82.939** shows it is in overbought territory. I will continue to hold this position as well, but closely monitor for any signs of reversal.\n\n3. **SOL Position**:\n   - Current price is **198.79**, entry price is **199.44**, resulting in a small unrealized loss of about **$7.50**.\n   - The stop-loss is set at **195.00** and the profit target at **210.00**. The invalidation condition indicates we must exit if the price closes below **195.00**.\n   - The price is above the stop-loss and invalidation condition, indicating that it is still safe to hold. The RSI at **76.503** suggests it is nearing overbought, but there are no immediate signals to exit.\n\n4. **BNB Position**:\n   - Current price is **1126.20**, entry price is **1133.50**, with an unrealized loss of approximately **$7.87**.\n   - The stop-loss is at **1100.00** and the profit target is **1200.00**. The invalidation condition is a close below **1100.00**.\n   - The price remains above the stop-loss and invalidation level, so I will hold this position. The MACD is slightly negative, indicating weakness, but not enough to warrant an exit yet.\n\n5. **XRP and DOGE**: \n   - No positions currently held in XRP or DOGE. I will not initiate any trades in these coins as current market conditions are not favorable for new entries.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.05,\n      \"profit_target\": 118000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 111000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 111000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1500.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 4300.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3900.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3900 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.70,\n      \"risk_usd\": 348.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 10.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 210.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 195.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 195 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 44.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1100.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1100 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.60,\n      \"risk_usd\": 133.5\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The market is showing strength, so holding is the right decision.\n\n**ETH Position:**\n- Current Price: 4206.10\n- Entry Price: 4074.90\n- Profit Target: 4300.00\n- Stop Loss: 3900.00\n- Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 3900 on 3-minute candle\n\nETH is also showing a strong bullish trend, with the current price well above the EMA20 and the entry price.

Since the invalidation condition is not met, I will hold the position.\n\n**ETH Position:**\n- Current Price: 4203.80\n- Entry Price: 4074.90\n- Stop-Loss: 3900.00\n- Profit Target: 4300.00\n- Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 3900 on 3-minute candle\n\nETH is also above its entry price, with the current price significantly above the EMA20 (4021.21). The RSI is at 92.441, which indicates overbought conditions similar to BTC, but the MACD is still showing positive momentum. The invalidation condition is not met, so I will hold this position as well.\n\n**SOL Position:**\n- Current Price: 202.49\n- Entry Price: 199.44\n- Stop-Loss: 195.00\n- Profit Target: 210.00\n- Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 195 on 3-minute candle\n\nSOL is also performing well, currently trading above its entry and EMA20 (196.28). The RSI (7 period) is at 70.256, indicating that it is approaching overbought territory. The MACD is positive, suggesting a continuing bullish trend. Since the invalidation condition is not met, I will hold this position.\n\n**BNB Position:**\n- Current Price: 1156.70\n- Entry Price: 1133.50\n- Stop-Loss: 1100.00\n- Profit Target: 1200.00\n- Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 1100 on 3-minute candle\n\nBNB is slightly in profit and above the EMA20 (1129.94). The RSI is at 86.115, indicating it is overbought. The MACD is also positive, but the strong RSI suggests caution. However, the invalidation condition has not been met, so I will hold this position.\n\n**XRP, DOGE Positions:**\nI do not have any positions in XRP or DOGE, and the market conditions do not warrant opening new positions in these coins.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.05,\n      \"profit_target\": 118000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 111000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 111000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1500.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 4300.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3900.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3900 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.70,\n      \"risk_usd\": 348.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 10.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 210.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 195.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 195 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 44.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1200.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1100.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1100 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.60,\n      \"risk_usd\": 133.50\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Although the RSI suggests overbought conditions, the MACD remains strong.

Therefore, I will hold this position as well.\n\n3. **SOL:**\n   - **Current Price:** 200.17\n   - **Entry Price:** 199.44\n   - **Stop Loss:** 195.00\n   - **Profit Target:** 210.00\n   - **Invalidation Condition:** Price closes below 195 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - **RSI:** 51.257 indicates neutral conditions, not overbought or oversold.\n   - **MACD:** 2.436 shows positive momentum, but less strength compared to BTC and ETH.\n   - **Analysis:** The position is slightly profitable and not close to the stop-loss or invalidation condition.

The RSI is at 34.819, indicating the potential for a reversal, and the MACD is positive, suggesting upward momentum. Therefore, I will hold this position.\n\n2. **ETH:**\n   - Current price: 4119.80, Entry price: 4074.90\n   - Unrealized PnL: $85.73, Stop-loss: 3900.00, Profit target: 4300.00\n   - Invalidation condition: If price closes below 3900 on 3-minute candle.\n   - The current price is comfortably above the stop-loss and invalidation condition. The RSI is at 39.129, indicating potential for upward movement, while MACD remains positive. Thus, I will also hold this position.\n\n3. **SOL:**\n   - Current price: 198.66, Entry price: 199.44\n   - Unrealized PnL: -$8.80, Stop-loss: 195.00, Profit target: 210.00\n   - Invalidation condition: If price closes below 195 on 3-minute candle.\n   - The current price is above the stop-loss but below the entry price. The RSI is at 36.495, indicating weakness, and the MACD is showing a declining trend. However, since it hasn't hit the invalidation condition, I will hold this position for now.\n\n4. **BNB:**\n   - Current price: 1138.50, Entry price: 1133.50\n   - Unrealized PnL: $4.43, Stop-loss: 1100.00, Profit target: 1200.00\n   - Invalidation condition: If price closes below 1100 on 3-minute candle.\n   - The price is above both the stop-loss and invalidation condition. The RSI is at 40.852, reflecting a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment. The MACD is positive but declining, hence I will hold this position as well.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nNone of the positions meet their invalidation criteria, and they are all above their respective stop-loss levels. Based on the technical indicators available, the decision is to hold all current positions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.05,\n      \"profit_target\": 118000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 111000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 111000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1500.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 4300.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3900.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3900 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 348.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 10.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 210.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 195.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 195 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 44.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1100.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1100 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 133.5\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The position is currently in profit with an unrealized PNL of 5.61. The stop-loss is set at 111000.00 and the profit target is at 118000.00. The invalidation condition states that if the price closes below 111000 on a 3-minute candle, I should exit. The current price is above the stop-loss and invalidation condition, and the momentum indicators (MACD at 912.781, RSI at 30.199) suggest that there is still potential for upward movement, albeit caution is warranted due to the low RSI indicating oversold conditions. Decision: **HOLD** as the invalidation condition is not met.\n\n2. **ETH**: Current price is 4093.40, with an entry price of 4074.90. The unrealized PNL is 32.93, and the stop-loss is at 3900.00 with a profit target of 4300.00. The invalidation condition is if the price closes below 3900 on a 3-minute candle.

The unrealized PNL is 17.00, stop-loss at 195.00, and profit target at 210.00. The invalidation condition is a close below 195 on a 3-minute candle. Currently, the price is above both the stop-loss and invalidation, with a MACD of 1.888 and an RSI of 62.230, which suggests a strong rally. Decision: **HOLD** as the invalidation condition is not met.\n\n4. **BNB**: Current price is 1137.50, with an entry price of 1133.50. The unrealized PNL is 3.43, stop-loss at 1100.00, and profit target at 1200.00. The invalidation condition is if the price closes below 1100 on a 3-minute candle. The current price is above the stop-loss and invalidation, with a MACD of 9.453 and an RSI of 39.738, which indicates weak momentum. Decision: **HOLD** as the invalidation condition is not met.\n\nOverall, all positions are currently above their respective stop-loss levels and invalidation conditions.
