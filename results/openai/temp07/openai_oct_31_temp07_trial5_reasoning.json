The MACD at -23.886 is also negative, but the RSI at 60.997 indicates bullish sentiment. However, the EMA being above the current price suggests caution.

The price is also above the stop-loss and invalidation level. The RSI at 70.251 indicates the asset is near overbought territory, but the upward momentum remains. As none of the exit conditions are met, I will **hold** this position.\n\n2. **ETH**:\n   - Current Price: 3980.40\n   - Entry Price: 4025.50\n   - Profit Target: 4200.00\n   - Stop-Loss: 3900.00\n   - Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 3950 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - The current price is below the entry price, resulting in an unrealized loss of approximately $117.78. It is also below the invalidation condition as the price is below 3950. The RSI at 40.564 suggests a bearish trend with potential selling pressure. Given that the invalidation condition has been met, I will **close the position** in ETH to mitigate further losses.\n\n3. **SOL**:\n   - Current Price: 188.77\n   - Entry Price: 191.14\n   - Profit Target: 200.00\n   - Stop-Loss: 185.00\n   - Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 187.00 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - The current price is below the entry price and has resulted in a minor unrealized loss of approximately $12.33. The price is above the stop-loss, and the invalidation level is not yet met. The RSI at 37.959 indicates a bearish trend but not oversold. Therefore, I will **hold** this position as it has not yet reached the invalidation level.\n\n4. **DOGE**:\n   - Current Price: 0.19953\n   - Entry Price: 0.19906\n   - Profit Target: 0.21\n   - Stop-Loss: 0.19\n   - Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 0.19500 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - The current price is just above the entry price, leading to a small unrealized gain of around $0.19. It is above the stop-loss and invalidation level. The RSI at 66.693 suggests that the asset is approaching overbought territory, but still within a reasonable range. Given that none of the exit conditions have been met, I will **hold** this position.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 115000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 107000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 108000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.70,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1000.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3900.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3950 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 312.5,\n      \"close_reason\": \"Invalidation met\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 200.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 185.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 187.00 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 30.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 500.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.21,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.19,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.19500 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.50,\n      \"risk_usd\": 40.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, I will monitor closely for any further deterioration.\n\n**Final Notes:**\n- The overall market conditions appear mixed with BTC showing strong momentum and others like ETH and SOL showing signs of potential weakness but not invalidated yet. Maintaining all positions for now aligns with my risk management strategy.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 118000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 112000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 112000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 4300.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 4000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 4000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 412.2\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 210.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 195.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 195 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 45.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The stop-loss is set at 112000.00, and the profit target is 118000.00. The invalidation condition states that if the price closes below 112000 on a 3-minute candle, I should exit the position. The RSI is at 65.894, indicating that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold, and the MACD is positive at 1077.492, suggesting bullish momentum. Despite the current minor loss, I still have room before hitting the stop-loss, and the indicators are supportive of holding the position.\n\n**ETH**: The current price for ETH is 4173.90, with an entry price of 4206.10. This results in an unrealized loss of about $68.61. The stop-loss is at 4000.00, and the profit target is at 4300.00. The invalidation condition is triggered if the price closes below 4000 on a 3-minute candle. The RSI is at 69.052, suggesting that ETH is approaching overbought territory, and the MACD is positive at 62.556. Given the proximity to the stop-loss and the current trend, I need to monitor this closely. However, the indicators still suggest a potential for recovery, so I will hold for now.\n\n**SOL**: The current price for SOL is 200.10, and I entered at 204.39, resulting in an unrealized loss of about $22.00. The stop-loss is set at 195.00, while the profit target is at 210.00. The invalidation condition is if the price closes below 195 on a 3-minute candle. The RSI is at 50.708, which indicates a neutral position, and the MACD is at 2.400, showing some signs of bullishness. However, I am very close to the stop-loss, and the current trend is not supportive. I will hold this position but keep an eye on it due to the risk of hitting the stop-loss.\n\n**Summary**: None of the positions meet their invalidation conditions, and while ETH and SOL are close to their stop-losses, the overall market indicators suggest holding for now.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 118000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 112000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 112000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 4300.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 4000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 4000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 412.2\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 210.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 195.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 195 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 45.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The current price is not attractive for a long position given the bearish indicators.\n\n2. **ETH (Ethereum)**: \n   - Current price: 3828.40\n   - EMA20: 3927.86 (bearish)\n   - MACD: -80.735 (downward momentum)\n   - RSI (7-period): 49.124 (neutral)\n   - Similar to BTC, ETH is also trading below its EMA20, with a negative MACD, indicating bearish market conditions.\n\n3. **SOL (Solana)**: \n   - Current price: 185.12\n   - EMA20: 192.16 (bearish)\n   - MACD: -3.518 (indicating downward momentum)\n   - RSI (7-period): 40.069 (neutral)\n   - The price is below the EMA20, and the MACD is also negative, reinforcing the bearish outlook.\n\n4. **BNB (Binance Coin)**: \n   - Current price: 1085.40\n   - EMA20: 1105.36 (bearish)\n   - MACD: -13.678 (downward momentum)\n   - RSI (7-period): 46.006 (neutral)\n   - Again, the indicators show a bearish sentiment with the price below the EMA20.\n\n5. **XRP (Ripple)**: \n   - Current price: 2.47\n   - EMA20: 2.55 (bearish)\n   - MACD: -0.047 (downward momentum)\n   - RSI (7-period): 44.415 (neutral)\n   - XRP is also showing bearish indicators, reinforcing caution.\n\n6. **DOGE (Dogecoin)**: \n   - Current price: 0.184400\n   - EMA20: 0.190549 (bearish)\n   - MACD: -0.004 (downward momentum)\n   - RSI (7-period): 47.165 (neutral)\n   - The bearish trend continues with the price below the EMA20.\n\nGiven the overall market condition across all coins indicating bearish trends and no positions currently held, it is prudent to refrain from entering new positions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"No open position to close\",\n      \"leverage\": 0,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"No open position\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"No open position to close\",\n      \"leverage\": 0,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"No open position\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"No open position to close\",\n      \"leverage\": 0,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"No open position\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"No open position to close\",\n      \"leverage\": 0,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"No open position\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"No open position to close\",\n      \"leverage\": 0,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"No open position\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"No open position to close\",\n      \"leverage\": 0,\n      \"confidence\": 0.0,\n      \"risk_usd\": 0,\n      \"close_reason\": \"No open position\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n``` \n\nNote: As there are no open positions, I have included all coins with a \"close_position\" signal for consistency in output formatting, indicating that there are no active trades to close. In practice, you would not issue a close signal for non-existent positions.",
