The invalidation condition is critical here; if the price closes below 2.40 on a 3-minute candle, I will need to exit the position to manage risk. The current price is above the stop-loss level, so I am not forced to close the position yet.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n- **RSI (7-period)**: 58.690, which indicates that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting potential for upward movement.\n- **MACD**: 0.033, which is relatively neutral and does not indicate a strong trend in either direction.\n- **EMA (20-period)**: 2.44, which is slightly below the current price, indicating a potential support level.\n\nGiven that the price is still above the stop-loss and the invalidation condition has not been met, I will hold the position for now. However, I will closely monitor the price action, especially considering the proximity to the invalidation level.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.80,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.40,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.40 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 120.0\n    }\n  }\n}",

Therefore, I will analyze the market conditions for each coin and determine if I should open new positions based on the provided data.\n\n### BTC Analysis:\n- **Current Price**: 108160.00\n- **EMA20**: 109293.56 (price is below EMA20, indicating a potential downtrend)\n- **MACD**: 526.423 (positive, but declining)\n- **RSI (7)**: 35.631 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- **Invalidation Condition**: If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle.\n\nGiven the current price is below the EMA20 and the RSI indicates oversold conditions, I would consider a buy if the price shows signs of reversal. However, the EMA trend suggests caution.\n\n### ETH Analysis:\n- **Current Price**: 3857.10\n- **EMA20**: 3941.92 (price is below EMA20)\n- **MACD**: 2.182 (positive but declining)\n- **RSI (7)**: 32.167 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- **Invalidation Condition**: If the price closes below 3800 on a 3-minute candle.\n\nSimilar to BTC, ETH is also below its EMA20 and has an RSI indicating oversold conditions. A buy could be considered if the price shows signs of reversal.\n\n### SOL Analysis:\n- **Current Price**: 185.16\n- **EMA20**: 188.66 (price is below EMA20)\n- **MACD**: 0.061 (positive but declining)\n- **RSI (7)**: 35.069 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- **Invalidation Condition**: If the price closes below 180 on a 3-minute candle.\n\nSOL is also below its EMA20 and has an RSI indicating oversold conditions. A buy could be considered if the price shows signs of reversal.\n\n### BNB Analysis:\n- **Current Price**: 1067.00\n- **EMA20**: 1090.85 (price is below EMA20)\n- **MACD**: -5.814 (negative)\n- **RSI (7)**: 38.218 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- **Invalidation Condition**: If the price closes below 1050 on a 3-minute candle.\n\nBNB shows a negative MACD and is below its EMA20, indicating a bearish trend. The RSI suggests it is oversold, but the overall trend is not favorable for a buy.\n\n### XRP Analysis:\n- **Current Price**: 2.42\n- **EMA20**: 2.43 (price is below EMA20)\n- **MACD**: 0.021 (positive but declining)\n- **RSI (7)**: 35.584 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- **Invalidation Condition**: If the price closes below 2.40 on a 3-minute candle.\n\nXRP is below its EMA20 and has an RSI indicating oversold conditions. A buy could be considered if the price shows signs of reversal.\n\n### DOGE Analysis:\n- **Current Price**: 0.193670\n- **EMA20**: 0.196050 (price is below EMA20)\n- **MACD**: 0.001 (positive but very weak)\n- **RSI (7)**: 34.396 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- **Invalidation Condition**: If the price closes below 0.190 on a 3-minute candle.\n\nDOGE is also below its EMA20 and has an RSI indicating oversold conditions. A buy could be considered if the price shows signs of reversal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the current market conditions, I will consider opening new positions in BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP as they all show oversold conditions. However, I will avoid BNB due to its negative MACD and bearish trend.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 111000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 105000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 105000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 116.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 4000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3800.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3800 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 114.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 190.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 180.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 180 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.60,\n      \"risk_usd\": 25.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 50.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.40,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.40 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.60,\n      \"risk_usd\": 10.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Given the high RSI, I would avoid entering a position at this time.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 4206.10\n- EMA20: 3996.72 (bullish trend)\n- MACD: 65.171 (positive momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 94.042 (overbought condition)\n- Similar to BTC, ETH shows strong bullish indicators but is also in an overbought condition. I will refrain from entering a position here as well.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 204.39\n- EMA20: 195.63 (bullish trend)\n- MACD: 2.367 (positive momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 90.921 (overbought condition)\n- Again, SOL is showing strong bullish indicators but is overbought.

I will avoid entering a position.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 2.63\n- EMA20: 2.56 (bullish trend)\n- MACD: 0.058 (weak momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 59.805 (neutral)\n- XRP is not showing strong bullish momentum compared to others. I will not enter a position.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 0.206800\n- EMA20: 0.199262 (bullish trend)\n- MACD: 0.002 (weak momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 84.698 (overbought condition)\n- DOGE is also overbought and does not present a favorable entry point.\n\nOverall, all coins are either overbought or lack sufficient momentum for a new position. Therefore, I will not enter any trades at this time.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{}\n```",

However, the low RSI indicates potential for a reversal. \n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 3978.00\n- EMA20: 4072.05 (price is below EMA, indicating a bearish trend)\n- MACD: 18.856 (positive but declining)\n- RSI (7-period): 11.565 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- Similar to BTC, ETH is also below its EMA20 and has a very low RSI, suggesting it is oversold. \n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 194.24\n- EMA20: 198.06 (price is below EMA, indicating a bearish trend)\n- MACD: 0.526 (positive but declining)\n- RSI (7-period): 17.724 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- SOL is also below its EMA20 and has a low RSI, indicating potential for a reversal.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 1102.30\n- EMA20: 1131.00 (price is below EMA, indicating a bearish trend)\n- MACD: 0.816 (positive but declining)\n- RSI (7-period): 12.382 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- BNB shows similar characteristics, being below its EMA20 and having a low RSI.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 2.60\n- EMA20: 2.63 (price is below EMA, indicating a bearish trend)\n- MACD: 0.005 (very low, indicating weak momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 21.015 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- XRP is also below its EMA20 and has a low RSI.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 0.193560\n- EMA20: 0.199558 (price is below EMA, indicating a bearish trend)\n- MACD: -0.000 (neutral)\n- RSI (7-period): 7.266 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- DOGE is below its EMA20 and has a very low RSI.\n\nGiven the analysis, all coins are currently in a bearish trend but are showing signs of being oversold. I will consider opening positions in BTC, ETH, SOL, and BNB due to their low RSI values, which suggest potential for a reversal.
