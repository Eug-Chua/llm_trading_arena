The MACD is negative, suggesting bearish momentum, but the RSI is at 64.338, indicating that the asset is nearing overbought territory.

However, the RSI is at 71.136, indicating that SOL is overbought. The MACD is also negative, suggesting bearish momentum. The invalidation condition has not been met as the price is above 175. Despite the overbought condition, the price is still above the stop-loss and invalidation levels, so I will hold this position as well.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth positions (BTC and SOL) are currently valid, and the invalidation conditions have not been met.

The MACD is close to neutral, and the RSI suggests oversold conditions.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 0.192900\n- EMA20: 0.198812 (price below EMA indicates bearish sentiment)\n- MACD: -0.001 (negative)\n- RSI (7 period): 6.467 (indicates oversold conditions)\n- DOGE is below its EMA20 and has a negative MACD, indicating a bearish trend. The RSI shows extreme oversold conditions.\n\nGiven the overall bearish sentiment across all coins, I will consider opening positions in BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP due to their oversold conditions, which may present a short-term trading opportunity. However, I will avoid DOGE and BNB due to their negative MACD and overall bearish trends.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 115000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 110000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 110000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4100.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3900.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3900 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 240.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 200.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 190.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 190.00 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 50.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 100,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.80,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.50,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.50 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 110.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
