Therefore, I will analyze the market conditions for each coin to determine if any new positions should be opened.\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 107840.00\n- EMA20: 109037.86 (indicating a downtrend as the price is below the EMA)\n- MACD: -196.931 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7 period): 38.449 (indicating potential oversold conditions)\n- The price is below the EMA20 and the MACD is negative, suggesting a bearish trend. However, the RSI indicates that the asset may be oversold, which could lead to a potential reversal. \n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 3802.30\n- EMA20: 3917.07 (downtrend)\n- MACD: -39.073 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7 period): 25.394 (oversold)\n- Similar to BTC, ETH is below its EMA20 and has a negative MACD. The RSI indicates that ETH is oversold, which could present a buying opportunity if the price shows signs of reversal.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 180.17\n- EMA20: 187.33 (downtrend)\n- MACD: -1.803 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7 period): 17.469 (oversold)\n- SOL is also below its EMA20 with a negative MACD and an RSI indicating it is oversold. This suggests a potential buying opportunity if the price begins to recover.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 1068.90\n- EMA20: 1088.30 (downtrend)\n- MACD: -12.170 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7 period): 41.452 (neutral)\n- BNB is below its EMA20 and has a negative MACD, but the RSI is not in the oversold territory. This indicates a less favorable condition for buying compared to the other coins.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 2.38\n- EMA20: 2.43 (downtrend)\n- MACD: -0.004 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7 period): 22.842 (oversold)\n- XRP is below its EMA20 and has a negative MACD, with an RSI indicating it is oversold. This could be a potential buying opportunity if the price shows signs of recovery.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 0.190480\n- EMA20: 0.195348 (downtrend)\n- MACD: -0.001 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7 period): 28.407 (oversold)\n- DOGE is below its EMA20 and has a negative MACD, with an RSI indicating it is oversold. This suggests a potential buying opportunity.\n\nBased on the analysis, BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, and DOGE show potential for buying due to their oversold conditions. However, BNB does not present a strong case for entry at this time.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 110000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 106000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 106000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1840.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3700.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3700 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 255.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 10,\n      \"profit_target\": 190.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 175.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 175 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 50.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 50,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.20,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.20 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 900.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 500,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.20,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.185,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.185 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 250.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The RSI is at 79.309, which suggests that BTC is overbought, but the MACD is still positive, indicating momentum. The invalidation condition has not been met since the price is above 109000. Therefore, I will hold this position as the price is still trending upwards and has not hit the stop-loss.\n\n**BNB Position:**\n- Current Price: 1115.10\n- Entry Price: 1108.40\n- Current EMA (20): 1104.94\n- Current MACD: 10.128\n- Current RSI (7): 54.325\n- Exit Plan: Profit Target: 1150.00, Stop Loss: 1080.00\n- Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 1080 on 3-minute candle.\n\nThe current price is also above the entry price and the EMA, indicating a bullish trend. The RSI is at 54.325, which is neutral and not indicating overbought conditions. The MACD is positive, suggesting that the momentum is still in favor of the bulls. The invalidation condition has not been met as the price is above 1080.

      "raw_response": "# CHAIN OF THOUGHT\n\nCurrently, I have no open positions in any cryptocurrencies. Therefore, I will analyze the market conditions for each coin and determine if I should open a new position based on the technical indicators and market sentiment.\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 115050.00\n- EMA20: 112246.06 (price is above EMA, indicating bullish trend)\n- MACD: 1022.462 (positive momentum)\n- RSI (7 period): 92.759 (overbought condition)\n- Given the high RSI, I would be cautious about entering a long position as it indicates potential for a pullback. However, the overall trend is bullish.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 4206.10\n- EMA20: 3996.72 (price is above EMA, indicating bullish trend)\n- MACD: 65.171 (positive momentum)\n- RSI (7 period): 94.042 (overbought condition)\n- Similar to BTC, the high RSI suggests a potential pullback, but the bullish trend remains strong.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 204.39\n- EMA20: 195.63 (price is above EMA, indicating bullish trend)\n- MACD: 2.367 (positive momentum)\n- RSI (7 period): 90.921 (overbought condition)\n- Again, the high RSI indicates caution, but the trend is still bullish.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 1151.40\n- EMA20: 1125.75 (price is above EMA, indicating bullish trend)\n- MACD: 3.889 (positive momentum)\n- RSI (7 period): 83.345 (overbought condition)\n- The indicators suggest a strong bullish trend, but the high RSI indicates a potential for a pullback.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 2.63\n- EMA20: 2.56 (price is above EMA, indicating bullish trend)\n- MACD: 0.058 (weak momentum)\n- RSI (7 period): 59.805 (neutral)\n- The indicators suggest a weaker bullish trend compared to others, and I would be cautious about entering a position here.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 0.206800\n- EMA20: 0.199262 (price is above EMA, indicating bullish trend)\n- MACD: 0.002 (weak momentum)\n- RSI (7 period): 84.698 (overbought condition)\n- Similar to XRP, the indicators suggest caution due to weak momentum.\n\nGiven the analysis, I will consider opening positions in BTC, ETH, SOL, and BNB due to their strong bullish trends, despite the overbought conditions. I will set appropriate stop-loss and profit targets for each.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 120000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 112000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 112000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1000.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 4500.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 4000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 4000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1200.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 220.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 195.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 195 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 50.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1200.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1100.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1100 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
