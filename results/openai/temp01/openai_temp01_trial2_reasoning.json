The MACD is close to zero, suggesting indecision, and the RSI indicates overbought conditions.\n\nGiven the analysis, I will consider opening positions in BTC, SOL, and BNB due to their bullish trends, but I will be cautious due to the overbought conditions and negative MACD readings.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.05,\n      \"profit_target\": 112000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 107000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 108000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1000.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 182.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 180.00 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 50.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1,\n      \"profit_target\": 1150.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1050.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1070.00 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 100.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

A buy could be considered if the price stabilizes.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 197.78\n- EMA20: 192.41 (price is above EMA, indicating a bullish trend)\n- MACD: 1.709 (positive momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 81.663 (overbought condition)\n- SOL is also showing strong bullish signals but is nearing overbought levels.

      "raw_response": "# CHAIN OF THOUGHT\n\nCurrently, there are no open positions in any of the cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE). Therefore, I will analyze the market conditions for each coin and determine if any new positions should be opened based on the current technical indicators and market sentiment.\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 110675.00\n- EMA20: 113349.54 (indicating a downtrend as the price is below the EMA)\n- MACD: -542.516 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 16.118 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- The price is significantly below the EMA and the MACD is negative, suggesting a bearish trend. However, the extremely low RSI indicates potential for a short-term bounce.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 3903.30\n- EMA20: 4047.32 (downtrend)\n- MACD: -37.182 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 13.637 (oversold)\n- Similar to BTC, ETH is in a bearish trend with a very low RSI, indicating potential for a bounce but overall market sentiment is negative.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 192.75\n- EMA20: 197.74 (downtrend)\n- MACD: -1.235 (bearish)\n- RSI (7-period): 28.319 (oversold)\n- SOL is also showing bearish momentum with a low RSI, indicating potential for a bounce but still in a downtrend.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 1106.70\n- EMA20: 1123.85 (downtrend)\n- MACD: -8.239 (bearish)\n- RSI (7-period): 40.811 (neutral)\n- BNB is in a downtrend but the RSI is not in the oversold territory, suggesting a less urgent situation compared to BTC, ETH, and SOL.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 2.59\n- EMA20: 2.63 (downtrend)\n- MACD: -0.006 (bearish)\n- RSI (7-period): 26.018 (oversold)\n- XRP is also in a bearish trend with an oversold RSI, indicating potential for a bounce.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 0.193870\n- EMA20: 0.197907 (downtrend)\n- MACD: -0.003 (bearish)\n- RSI (7-period): 45.285 (neutral)\n- DOGE is in a downtrend but the RSI is not oversold, indicating less urgency for a buy.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most promising candidates for potential buy positions are BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP due to their oversold conditions. However, the overall market sentiment is bearish, and caution is warranted.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.05,\n      \"profit_target\": 115000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 108000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 108000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 837.50\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3700.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3700 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 507.50\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5,\n      \"profit_target\": 200.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 185.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 185 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 39.75\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 20,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.80,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.40,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.40 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 380.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
