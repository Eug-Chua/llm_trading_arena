Therefore, I will analyze the market conditions for each coin to determine if any new positions should be opened.\n\n### BTC Analysis\n- **Current Price**: 109160.00\n- **EMA20**: 111104.55 (indicating a bearish trend as the price is below the EMA)\n- **MACD**: -1429.362 (indicating bearish momentum)\n- **RSI (7 period)**: 43.856 (neutral, not overbought or oversold)\n- **Market Sentiment**: The price is below the EMA20 and the MACD is negative, suggesting a bearish trend. The RSI indicates that the market is not in an extreme state, but the overall trend is not favorable for a buy.\n\n### ETH Analysis\n- **Current Price**: 3930.90\n- **EMA20**: 4023.44 (bearish trend)\n- **MACD**: -71.784 (bearish momentum)\n- **RSI (7 period)**: 45.554 (neutral)\n- **Market Sentiment**: Similar to BTC, ETH is below its EMA20 and has a negative MACD. The RSI is neutral, indicating no immediate buying opportunity.\n\n### SOL Analysis\n- **Current Price**: 186.91\n- **EMA20**: 195.30 (bearish trend)\n- **MACD**: -5.057 (bearish momentum)\n- **RSI (7 period)**: 35.557 (approaching oversold)\n- **Market Sentiment**: SOL is also below its EMA20 with a negative MACD. The RSI is approaching oversold territory, but the overall trend remains bearish.\n\n### BNB Analysis\n- **Current Price**: 1149.30\n- **EMA20**: 1188.16 (bearish trend)\n- **MACD**: -31.536 (bearish momentum)\n- **RSI (7 period)**: 37.756 (neutral)\n- **Market Sentiment**: BNB is below its EMA20 and has a negative MACD. The RSI is neutral, indicating no strong buying signal.\n\n### XRP Analysis\n- **Current Price**: 2.36\n- **EMA20**: 2.44 (bearish trend)\n- **MACD**: -0.058 (bearish momentum)\n- **RSI (7 period)**: 41.475 (neutral)\n- **Market Sentiment**: XRP is below its EMA20 with a negative MACD. The RSI is neutral, suggesting no immediate buying opportunity.\n\n### DOGE Analysis\n- **Current Price**: 0.190230\n- **EMA20**: 0.198261 (bearish trend)\n- **MACD**: -0.005 (bearish momentum)\n- **RSI (7 period)**: 37.342 (neutral)\n- **Market Sentiment**: DOGE is below its EMA20 and has a negative MACD. The RSI is neutral, indicating no strong buying signal.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the current market conditions across all analyzed cryptocurrencies, there are no favorable conditions to open new positions. All coins are showing bearish trends with negative MACD indicators and prices below their respective EMA20s. Therefore, I will not initiate any trades at this time.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{}\n```",

Given that the price is close to the stop-loss and the invalidation condition is not met yet, I will hold this position for now.\n\n**BTC Position:**\n- Current Price: 111396.00, Entry Price: 110659.00\n- Current unrealized PnL: 34.08\n- Stop-Loss: 108000.00, Profit Target: 113000.00\n- Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 108000 on a 3-minute candle.\n- The current price is well above the stop-loss and entry price, indicating a profitable position. The RSI is at 63.664, which is not overbought, and the MACD is positive, suggesting bullish momentum. Since the invalidation condition is not met, I will hold this position.\n\n**ETH Position:**\n- Current Price: 3933.30, Entry Price: 3927.20\n- Current unrealized PnL: 8.27\n- Stop-Loss: 3850.00, Profit Target: 4000.00\n- Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 3850 on a 3-minute candle.\n- The current price is above both the stop-loss and entry price, indicating a slight profit. The RSI is at 57.474, which is neutral, and the MACD is positive, indicating bullish momentum. The invalidation condition is not met, so I will hold this position.\n\nOverall, all positions are currently above their respective stop-loss levels and the invalidation conditions are not met. Therefore, I will hold all existing positions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1150.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1080.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1080 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 140.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.05,\n      \"profit_target\": 113000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 108000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 108000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 82.95\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 4000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3850.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3850 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 154.0\n    }\n  }\n}",
