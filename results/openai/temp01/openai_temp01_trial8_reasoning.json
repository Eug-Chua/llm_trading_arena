Therefore, I will analyze the market conditions for each coin and determine if any new positions should be opened based on the current price action, technical indicators, and risk management principles.\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 105589.00\n- EMA20: 110349.98 (indicating a downtrend as the price is below the EMA)\n- MACD: -1386.482 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 17.826 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- The price is significantly below the EMA and the MACD is negative, suggesting a bearish trend. However, the RSI indicates that the asset is oversold, which could lead to a potential bounce. \n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 3756.40\n- EMA20: 3986.21 (downtrend)\n- MACD: -68.509 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 20.606 (oversold)\n- Similar to BTC, ETH is also in a downtrend with the price below the EMA and a negative MACD. The RSI indicates oversold conditions, suggesting a possible reversal.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 177.65\n- EMA20: 193.22 (downtrend)\n- MACD: -5.298 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 16.373 (oversold)\n- SOL shows a bearish trend with the price below the EMA and a negative MACD. The RSI indicates oversold conditions, which could signal a potential bounce.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 1062.60\n- EMA20: 1174.19 (downtrend)\n- MACD: -35.001 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 9.549 (very oversold)\n- BNB is in a strong downtrend with a very low RSI, indicating extreme oversold conditions. This could lead to a potential reversal.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 2.24\n- EMA20: 2.41 (downtrend)\n- MACD: -0.059 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 17.426 (oversold)\n- XRP is also in a downtrend with a negative MACD and an oversold RSI, indicating potential for a bounce.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 0.178490\n- EMA20: 0.195551 (downtrend)\n- MACD: -0.005 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 14.759 (oversold)\n- DOGE is in a downtrend with a negative MACD and an oversold RSI, suggesting a potential reversal.\n\nGiven the analysis, all coins are currently in a bearish trend but are showing oversold conditions. This could present an opportunity to buy into potential reversals. However, I will be cautious and set appropriate stop-loss and profit targets to manage risk effectively.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 110000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 103000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 103000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 589.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 3900.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3600.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3600 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 390.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 50,\n      \"profit_target\": 190.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 170 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 382.50\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5,\n      \"profit_target\": 1150.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 312.50\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 100,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.10,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.10 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 140.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5000,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.20,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.15,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.15 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 165.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, the technical indicators suggest a bearish trend across the board, and I will maintain my current positions without closing or adding to them.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 110000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 103000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 103000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 589.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 3900.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3600.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3600 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 390.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 50.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 190.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 170 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 382.5\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1150.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 312.5\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 100.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.5,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.1,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.10 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 140.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.2,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.15,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.15 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 165.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The RSI indicates oversold conditions, suggesting a potential for a short-term bounce, but the overall trend remains bearish.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 192.75\n- EMA20: 197.74 (bearish trend)\n- MACD: -1.235 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 28.319 (oversold)\n- SOL is also below its EMA and has a negative MACD. The RSI indicates oversold conditions, which could lead to a bounce, but the trend is still bearish.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 1106.70\n- EMA20: 1123.85 (bearish trend)\n- MACD: -8.239 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 40.811 (neutral)\n- BNB is below its EMA and has a negative MACD. The RSI is not in oversold territory, indicating that there may be more downside potential.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 2.59\n- EMA20: 2.63 (bearish trend)\n- MACD: -0.006 (neutral)\n- RSI (7-period): 26.018 (oversold)\n- XRP is slightly below its EMA and has a neutral MACD. The RSI indicates oversold conditions, suggesting a potential for a bounce.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 0.193870\n- EMA20: 0.197907 (bearish trend)\n- MACD: -0.003 (neutral)\n- RSI (7-period): 45.285 (neutral)\n- DOGE is below its EMA but has a neutral MACD and RSI, indicating no strong signals for a trade.\n\nGiven the analysis, I will consider opening positions in BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP due to their oversold conditions, while BNB and DOGE do not present strong opportunities at this time.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 115000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 108000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 108000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1000.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4100.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3800.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3800 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 250.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 200.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 185.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 185 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 39.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 50.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.80,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.40,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.40 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.5,\n      \"risk_usd\": 950.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
