Therefore, I will analyze the market conditions for each coin and determine whether to open new positions based on the technical indicators and market sentiment.\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 105589.00\n- EMA20: 110349.98 (indicating a downtrend)\n- MACD: -1386.482 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 17.826 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- The price is significantly below the EMA20, indicating a bearish trend. The RSI suggests that the asset is oversold, which could indicate a potential reversal, but the overall trend remains bearish.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 3756.40\n- EMA20: 3986.21 (indicating a downtrend)\n- MACD: -68.509 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 20.606 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- Similar to BTC, ETH is below its EMA20 and has a bearish MACD. The RSI indicates oversold conditions, but the trend is still down.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 177.65\n- EMA20: 193.22 (indicating a downtrend)\n- MACD: -5.298 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 16.373 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- SOL is also below its EMA20 with a bearish MACD and an oversold RSI, indicating a potential for a reversal but still in a downtrend.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 1062.60\n- EMA20: 1174.19 (indicating a downtrend)\n- MACD: -35.001 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 9.549 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- BNB shows a strong downtrend with a very low RSI, suggesting it is heavily oversold.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 2.24\n- EMA20: 2.41 (indicating a downtrend)\n- MACD: -0.059 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 17.426 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- XRP is below its EMA20 and has a bearish MACD, with an oversold RSI.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 0.178490\n- EMA20: 0.195551 (indicating a downtrend)\n- MACD: -0.005 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 14.759 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- DOGE is also in a downtrend with a bearish MACD and an oversold RSI.\n\nGiven the overall bearish sentiment across all coins, I will consider opening positions in BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP, and DOGE, as they are all showing oversold conditions which may present a buying opportunity.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 110000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 104000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 104000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 589.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 3900.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3700.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3700 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 140.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 10,\n      \"profit_target\": 190.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 170 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 70.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5,\n      \"profit_target\": 1150.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 310.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 50,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.10,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.10 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 700.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5000,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.20,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.15,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.15 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 165.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Therefore, I will analyze the market conditions for each coin and determine if I should open a new position.\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 115050.00\n- EMA20: 112246.06 (price is above EMA, indicating a bullish trend)\n- MACD: 1022.462 (positive momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 92.759 (overbought condition)\n- Given the high RSI, I would typically be cautious about entering a position, but the strong bullish indicators suggest that momentum could continue. However, the overbought condition raises the risk of a pullback.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 4206.10\n- EMA20: 3996.72 (price is above EMA, indicating a bullish trend)\n- MACD: 65.171 (positive momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 94.042 (overbought condition)\n- Similar to BTC, the high RSI indicates overbought conditions, but the bullish trend and momentum suggest potential for further gains. \n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 204.39\n- EMA20: 195.63 (price is above EMA, indicating a bullish trend)\n- MACD: 2.367 (positive momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 90.921 (overbought condition)\n- The indicators suggest a strong bullish trend, but the overbought RSI indicates a potential for a pullback.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 1151.40\n- EMA20: 1125.75 (price is above EMA, indicating a bullish trend)\n- MACD: 3.889 (positive momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 83.345 (overbought condition)\n- The bullish indicators are strong, but the high RSI suggests caution.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 2.63\n- EMA20: 2.56 (price is above EMA, indicating a bullish trend)\n- MACD: 0.058 (weak momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 59.805 (neutral)\n- The indicators are not as strong as the other coins, and the lack of momentum suggests that this may not be a favorable entry point.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 0.206800\n- EMA20: 0.199262 (price is above EMA, indicating a bullish trend)\n- MACD: 0.002 (weak momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 84.698 (overbought condition)\n- Similar to XRP, the momentum is weak, and while the price is above the EMA, the overbought condition suggests caution.\n\nGiven the analysis, I will consider opening positions in BTC, ETH, SOL, and BNB due to their strong bullish indicators, despite the overbought conditions.
