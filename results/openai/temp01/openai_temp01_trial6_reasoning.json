Therefore, I will analyze the market conditions for each coin and determine whether to open new positions based on the technical indicators and market sentiment.\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 105589.00\n- EMA20: 110349.98 (indicating a bearish trend as the price is below the EMA)\n- MACD: -1386.482 (indicating bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 17.826 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- The price is significantly below the EMA and the MACD is negative, suggesting a continuation of the downtrend. However, the RSI indicates that the asset is oversold, which could lead to a potential bounce. \n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 3756.40\n- EMA20: 3986.21 (bearish trend)\n- MACD: -68.509 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 20.606 (oversold)\n- Similar to BTC, ETH is below its EMA and has a negative MACD, indicating bearish momentum. The RSI suggests oversold conditions, which could lead to a short-term bounce.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 177.65\n- EMA20: 193.22 (bearish trend)\n- MACD: -5.298 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 16.373 (oversold)\n- SOL is also below its EMA and has a negative MACD. The RSI indicates it is oversold, suggesting a potential for a bounce.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 1062.60\n- EMA20: 1174.19 (bearish trend)\n- MACD: -35.001 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 9.549 (extremely oversold)\n- BNB shows a strong bearish trend with a very low RSI, indicating extreme oversold conditions. This could lead to a potential bounce, but the overall trend remains bearish.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 2.24\n- EMA20: 2.41 (bearish trend)\n- MACD: -0.059 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 17.426 (oversold)\n- XRP is below its EMA and has a negative MACD. The RSI indicates oversold conditions, suggesting a potential for a bounce.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 0.178490\n- EMA20: 0.195551 (bearish trend)\n- MACD: -0.005 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 14.759 (oversold)\n- DOGE is also in a bearish trend with a low RSI, indicating oversold conditions.\n\nGiven the analysis, all coins are currently in a bearish trend but are showing signs of being oversold. I will consider opening positions in BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP due to their oversold conditions, while BNB and DOGE will be excluded due to their extreme oversold conditions and overall bearish trends.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 110000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 103000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 103000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 589.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 3900.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3600.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3600 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 390.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 10,\n      \"profit_target\": 190.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 170 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 76.50\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.10,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.10 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 70.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Given the current momentum and the fact that the invalidation condition has not been met, I will hold this position.\n\n2. **XRP Position:**\n   - Current Price: 2.3739\n   - Entry Price: 2.2374\n   - Profit Target: 2.50\n   - Stop-Loss: 2.10\n   - Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 2.10 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Current RSI (7-period): 63.348 indicates a bullish trend but approaching overbought territory.\n   - Current MACD: -0.006 is neutral, suggesting no strong momentum in either direction.\n   - The price is above the stop-loss and invalidation condition, and nearing the profit target. Given the current conditions, I will also hold this position.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth positions (SOL and XRP) are currently above their respective stop-loss levels and invalidation conditions. The market indicators suggest that while both are nearing their profit targets, they have not yet triggered any exit conditions. Therefore, I will hold both positions.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 10.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 190.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 170 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 76.5\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.5,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.1,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.10 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 70.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The oversold RSI suggests a potential reversal, but the MACD is negative, indicating continued bearish momentum.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 184.99\n- EMA20: 187.77 (bearish trend)\n- MACD: -0.179 (negative momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 34.975 (not oversold)\n- SOL is also below its EMA20, indicating a bearish trend. The RSI is not in the oversold territory, suggesting that there may be further downside potential.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 1068.70\n- EMA20: 1085.93 (bearish trend)\n- MACD: -5.915 (negative momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 40.325 (not oversold)\n- BNB is below its EMA20, indicating a bearish trend. The RSI is not oversold, suggesting that there may be further downside potential.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 2.39\n- EMA20: 2.43 (bearish trend)\n- MACD: 0.014 (neutral)\n- RSI (7-period): 28.032 (oversold)\n- XRP is below its EMA20, indicating a bearish trend. The oversold RSI suggests a potential reversal, but the MACD is neutral.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 0.190860\n- EMA20: 0.195075 (bearish trend)\n- MACD: 0.001 (neutral)\n- RSI (7-period): 26.207 (oversold)\n- DOGE is below its EMA20, indicating a bearish trend. The oversold RSI suggests a potential reversal, but the MACD is neutral.\n\nGiven the analysis, I will consider opening positions in BTC, ETH, and XRP due to their oversold conditions, while SOL, BNB, and DOGE do not present favorable conditions for entry.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 110000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 105000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 105000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 3900.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3750.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3750 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.60,\n      \"risk_usd\": 150.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 50.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.30,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.30 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 450.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, the RSI is at 84.600, which suggests that BTC is overbought.\n- The exit plan has a profit target of 120000.00 and a stop-loss at 112000.00. The invalidation condition is if the price closes below 112000 on a 3-minute candle.\n- Since the current price is above the stop-loss and invalidation condition, I will **hold** this position, but I need to be cautious due to the high RSI indicating potential overbought conditions.\n\n**ETH Position:**\n- Current Price: 4162.80, Entry Price: 4206.10\n- Current EMA20: 4042.50, MACD: 59.340, RSI (7 period): 65.832\n- The price is below the entry price and close to the stop-loss of 4000.00. The RSI is at 65.832, which is not overly high but indicates some bullish momentum.\n- The invalidation condition is if the price closes below 4000 on a 3-minute candle.

The RSI indicates a neutral position.\n- The invalidation condition is if the price closes below 195.00 on a 3-minute candle. Since the current price is above the stop-loss, I will **hold** this position, but it is under pressure and needs to be watched.\n\n**BNB Position:**\n- Current Price: 1180.00, Entry Price: 1151.40\n- Current EMA20: 1133.36, MACD: 9.377, RSI (7 period): 93.078\n- The price is above the entry price and the EMA20, indicating a strong bullish trend. However, the RSI is extremely high at 93.078, suggesting that BNB is overbought.\n- The exit plan has a profit target of 1200.00 and a stop-loss at 1100.00.

I will not consider a buy for DOGE.\n\nIn summary, I will consider opening new positions for BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP due to their oversold conditions and potential for a bounce.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 115000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 110000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 110000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 500.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 4100.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3900.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3900 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 240.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 200.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 190.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 190 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.60,\n      \"risk_usd\": 25.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 100,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.80,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.50,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.50 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.55,\n      \"risk_usd\": 110.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
