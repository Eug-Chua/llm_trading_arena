Therefore, I will analyze the market conditions for each coin and determine if any new positions should be opened based on the current price action and technical indicators.\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 109160.00\n- EMA20: 111104.55 (indicating a bearish trend as the price is below the EMA)\n- MACD: -1429.362 (negative, indicating bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 43.856 (neutral, not overbought or oversold)\n- The price is below both the EMA20 and the recent highs, suggesting a bearish outlook. Given the current conditions, I will not open a position in BTC.\n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 3930.90\n- EMA20: 4023.44 (bearish trend)\n- MACD: -71.784 (negative momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 45.554 (neutral)\n- Similar to BTC, ETH is also below its EMA20 and has negative MACD momentum. Therefore, I will not open a position in ETH.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 186.91\n- EMA20: 195.30 (bearish trend)\n- MACD: -5.057 (negative momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 35.557 (approaching oversold)\n- SOL is also in a bearish trend, and while it is approaching oversold conditions, the overall trend is not favorable for opening a position.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 1149.30\n- EMA20: 1188.16 (bearish trend)\n- MACD: -31.536 (negative momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 37.756 (neutral)\n- BNB is below its EMA20 and has negative momentum, indicating a bearish outlook. No position will be opened here.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 2.36\n- EMA20: 2.44 (bearish trend)\n- MACD: -0.058 (slightly negative)\n- RSI (7-period): 41.475 (neutral)\n- XRP is also in a bearish trend, and the indicators do not suggest a favorable entry point.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 0.190230\n- EMA20: 0.198261 (bearish trend)\n- MACD: -0.005 (slightly negative)\n- RSI (7-period): 37.342 (neutral)\n- DOGE is below its EMA20 and has a bearish outlook, so I will not open a position.\n\nOverall, the market conditions across all analyzed coins are bearish, and none of the indicators suggest a favorable entry point for new positions. Therefore, I will not open any trades at this time.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{}\n```",

This could present an opportunity to buy, especially if a reversal occurs. However, caution is warranted due to the overall bearish momentum.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 110000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 104000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 104000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 589.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 3900.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3600.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3600 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 390.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 50,\n      \"profit_target\": 190.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 170 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 382.50\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5,\n      \"profit_target\": 1150.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 312.50\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 100,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.10,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.10 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 140.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5000,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.20,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.15,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.15 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 165.00\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

However, the bearish indicators suggest caution.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 110000.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 104000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 104000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 589.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.5,\n      \"profit_target\": 3900.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3600.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3600 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 390.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 50.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 190.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 170.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 170 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 382.5\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1150.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1000.0,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 312.5\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 100.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.50,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.10,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.10 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 140.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.20,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.15,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.15 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 165.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
