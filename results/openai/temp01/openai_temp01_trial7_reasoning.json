Therefore, I will analyze the market conditions for each coin and determine if I should open a new position based on the technical indicators and market sentiment.\n\n**BTC**: \n- Current Price: 113569.00\n- EMA20: 113523.89 (slightly bullish as current price is above EMA)\n- MACD: 341.506 (positive momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 50.544 (neutral)\n- The price is currently above the EMA20, indicating a potential bullish trend. However, the RSI is neutral, suggesting that there is no strong momentum. Given the lack of a clear trend and the current price being relatively close to the EMA, I will not open a position.\n\n**ETH**: \n- Current Price: 4022.80\n- EMA20: 4057.38 (current price below EMA)\n- MACD: 11.095 (positive but weak)\n- RSI (7-period): 39.414 (bearish)\n- The price is below the EMA20, indicating a bearish trend. The RSI is also below 40, suggesting weakness. Therefore, I will not open a position here.\n\n**SOL**: \n- Current Price: 195.67\n- EMA20: 197.29 (current price below EMA)\n- MACD: 0.241 (weak positive momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 40.842 (bearish)\n- Similar to ETH, SOL is below its EMA20 and the RSI indicates weakness. I will not open a position.\n\n**BNB**: \n- Current Price: 1116.60\n- EMA20: 1127.40 (current price below EMA)\n- MACD: -2.257 (negative momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 44.246 (neutral)\n- The price is below the EMA20 and the MACD is negative, indicating a bearish trend. I will not open a position.\n\n**XRP**: \n- Current Price: 2.63\n- EMA20: 2.63 (current price at EMA)\n- MACD: 0.003 (neutral)\n- RSI (7-period): 57.614 (neutral)\n- The price is at the EMA, but the MACD is neutral and the RSI is not strongly bullish. I will not open a position.\n\n**DOGE**: \n- Current Price: 0.194270\n- EMA20: 0.198173 (current price below EMA)\n- MACD: -0.001 (negative momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 28.413 (bearish)\n- The price is below the EMA20 and the RSI indicates bearish momentum. I will not open a position.\n\nIn summary, all coins are either in a bearish trend or lack sufficient bullish momentum to justify opening a new position. Therefore, I will not initiate any trades at this time.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{}\n```",

Therefore, I will analyze the market conditions for each coin and determine if I should open a new position based on the current technical indicators.\n\n**BTC Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 107752.00\n- EMA20: 112149.68 (indicating a downtrend as the price is below the EMA)\n- MACD: -1446.039 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 15.731 (indicating oversold conditions)\n- The price is significantly below the EMA and the MACD is negative, suggesting a bearish trend. However, the RSI indicates that the asset is oversold, which could lead to a potential reversal. \n\n**ETH Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 3772.70\n- EMA20: 3988.91 (downtrend)\n- MACD: -75.593 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 10.285 (oversold)\n- Similar to BTC, ETH is also in a downtrend with the price below the EMA and a negative MACD. The RSI indicates oversold conditions, suggesting a potential for a bounce.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 185.02\n- EMA20: 195.60 (downtrend)\n- MACD: -2.250 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 16.294 (oversold)\n- SOL is also showing a bearish trend with the price below the EMA and a negative MACD. The RSI indicates oversold conditions.\n\n**BNB Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 1076.10\n- EMA20: 1122.12 (downtrend)\n- MACD: -17.547 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 15.277 (oversold)\n- BNB is in a similar situation, with bearish indicators and an oversold RSI.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 2.45\n- EMA20: 2.59 (downtrend)\n- MACD: -0.026 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 12.077 (oversold)\n- XRP also shows bearish momentum with oversold conditions.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- Current Price: 0.180550\n- EMA20: 0.194229 (downtrend)\n- MACD: -0.004 (bearish momentum)\n- RSI (7-period): 10.696 (oversold)\n- DOGE is similarly positioned with bearish indicators and an oversold RSI.\n\nGiven the overall market conditions, all coins are in a downtrend but are showing signs of being oversold. I will consider opening positions in BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP, and DOGE, as they all have potential for a bounce back.\n\n# TRADING DECISIONS\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.1,\n      \"profit_target\": 112000.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 105000.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 105000 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1750.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 2.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 3900.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3600.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 3600 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 344.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 10.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 195.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 180.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 180 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 50.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 1100.00,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1020.00,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 1020 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 56.10\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.60,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.30,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 2.30 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 75.00\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy\",\n      \"quantity\": 5000.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.20,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.175,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 0.175 on 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 27.50\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The RSI is at 37.08, indicating a bearish trend. Given the low unrealized PnL and the bearish indicators, I will hold this position.\n\n4. **XRP**: \n   - Current price: 2.44, Entry price: 2.4523. \n   - Unrealized PnL: -$0.08. \n   - Stop-loss: 2.30, Profit target: 2.60. \n   - Invalidation condition: If price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle. \n   - The current price is above the stop-loss and invalidation condition.
